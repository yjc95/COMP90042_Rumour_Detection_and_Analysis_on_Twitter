no more danger than any other essential food items right because of the competition act ttansmission via food packaging is not known yet but there is evidence the virus can stay on surfaces for periods of time minister pls tell us are there any deaths that were reported of ppl who died without a testing thanks for confirming that there s no reason to believe food packaging can transmit covid until we get the first case rather be safe why cant i buy prepared food at the grocery shop they say it s not fair as far as the competition act that no prepared food can be can be sold that s why restaurants are closed because we can cook please all those found to be positive must be taken to quarantine together with immediately families otherwise we will have countless numbers adding if that is not done can we follow the rules on quarantine and social distancing published by st georges unviversitu of london they seem to be much safer than what we are doing now they recommend a 2m distance and also they steps and guidelines in disinfecting consultation rooms and test centers if there is no confirmed case passed through food or food packaging then why are restaurant takeaways not allowed

mention there is no evidence of human2human transmission look at us now this is said that s not even r500 not all basic foods are covered there so what about those people who resists like when you

cases confirmed from food packaging from the cases that are currently confirmed is there a method to test where how and when they have occurred hello dr why can t we all get tested because it dsnt get better i m not sure of this news about dis chem workers i m so scared at the moment how many customers has this virus who was at that dis chem how long is covid going to last in sa retail staff and merchies are not social distancing they always standing together in the aisles chatting sharing phone screens etc very worrying gauteng needs total shutdown please instruct retailers to issue their staff with face masks we cannot stay 1m away from cashiers when paying dr according to you the inevitable outcome for us all is testing positive for covid this means even if i test negative today i can still get it tomorrow so how do we trust your fellow colleagues who will apparently be testing us with pick n pay you can order online and they deliver at your doorstep that s how i ve been

on your tweet is this in the uk if this shit comes to us i will never eat again kfc is most likely only a subsidiary franchise when ye consider ruling factors of th s fortunately tweeting seems to be turning the tide because kfc know their uk market kfc is a business bye bye ms american pie go to chik filet popeyes churches or a local deli of some type probably better anyway if only that s already happening in australia there s hahal only browns chickens too bc they buy them amp then they have somewhere to patronize if you sell food in birmingham amp it s not halal you sell less food demand side economics profit motive some ignorant pc lefty decision obviously made by someone who doesn t understand islam or muslims immigration is good but you emigrate to live a different life and simulate the culture of the land and laws why are there islam controlled uk cities then the muslims go home and drink in private hypocrites to the max islam bans drinking alcohol do kfc provide wipes to suck on this is a joke right this stupidity has got to stop don t use a wipe use a muslim or have i read this wrong which customers do they need the most muslims or everyone else that has been their customers for decades amp never burned one this isn t true fyi in case anyone is still interested in what s factual agree stop the evil religion amp government via amp poor ole colonel is no doubt rolling in his grave ban kfc and cancel passports of all britishers who do not booze no more kfc place is garbage food anyhow lt lt see what you have done not listening to customers breaks balls getting it yet easily the stupidest story i ve read in awhile ppl are clueless alcohol is essential for disinfection ffs satire or are just thick eat mor chickin no keep going and maby you get behead so go support them no more kenfucky fried chicken for me i eat american only not some muslim hugging chicken strange i m a nurse amp never once did a muslim patient ask me not to use an alcohol wipe before an injection i am israel simplified disagree see amp gt negative then we lose ground we fight and take back whats ours either they abide by our rules or they can leave its all so utterly petty drives me insane just their way of pushing sharia shit lol re elbows false economic counter jihad is needed what are u kidding me they really did that kfc wish i hadn t spent my money at your place today they are too sensitive amp that s a fact where s their tolerance i don t eat their originally secret too damn greasy chicken it means there is a market shows you how many are there kfc halal branches listed here rest are non halal why no labels and subway stores have taken pork prducts off of menur ban chicken next tell the muslims to stop eating the darned wipes they ll be stoping our supermarkets supplying pork next because it offends them what a fucking joke the colonel would be turning in his grave if they don t like it piss off why do we keep pandering to these people r u kidding me they sure have a lot of clout here the ban islam crap is a bit much the hand wipes are equally a bit much what that is retarded ukip is basically just made up of former tories nothing changes but the name have we all gone mad i don t eat the stuff anyway its chickens have elbows some people need to get a fucking reality check customers should ask and refuse halal kill them economically i thought muslims don t eat pork whats with the wipes i like there biscuits pass the damn bacon if the muslims are idiotic enough to suck on the wipes it s their problem not kfc s well said and how come they are never offended by the benefits they claim from us infidels gt lt can it ban muslims if they don t like what we have well they can just move back to the hell hole they came from r shut up that seems very extreme diverse cultures have an option to partake or abstain if u disagree don t use them people who eat in kfc s are the sort of people who make love to vacuum cleaners read the article properly it was a member of staff american style chicken offends me has to be british or is like sponsoring terrorists have you noticed the lack of skin on chicken portions in your local smkt ffs the kfcs in mid east give out wet wipes in my limited experience of mid east kfcs uk gone mad priv corp so not a big deal in my mind they need to accommodate the market share they want check out chick fil a must better than kfc what s next a burqa for the colonel no female employees why not tofu chicken so as not to offend peta yes stamp it out now or it really will be too late it s a terrible story it really is i never saw animal rights activists protest halal the most cruel method to kill animals birds for meat dumb question why do muslims hate alcohol ban it in hospitals too horrible stuff tried all sorts of mixers with it too the religion of sucks so does and there s alcohol in them they give them away free demand bacon at kfc kentucky fried cr p fed up of having other religions rammed down my throat if i wanted to be a muslim i would become one kfc off my list then cheers i am an american offended by obama just how ridiculous can we get this all pisses me off tell them to go home if they don t like how we live i m vegie anyhow erm i think islamic world pioneered use of alcohol for medical purposes it s consumption that s forbidden you guys are turning into france wipes are not required to be used are they smile tell the fussies where the dry napkins are and who can i help next the once great british empire will be dirt roads and mud huts in a hundred years if not sooner it s not consumable alcohol ie ethanol what s next screenwash that s right patriot we need to let the corporates who really is in charge in america that being we the american people a muslim leader said banning of wipes was bizarre and kfc have apologised so no need to stop visiting is disgusting anyway that s the main reason to ban them dafuq they don t even know the diff between rubbing alcohol and drinking alcohol rl idiocracy what kind of drivel is this you re spouting there he boycotted alcohol wipes zibidi get deported not aware of that religion from the thats exactly why the problem exists because people have i for one have had enough when in rome stupid if an alcohol wipe offends then i guess they should just use their shit covered hands to eat the halal crap it already is when the likes of anjem chowdry freely roam the streets of londonistan why boycott them over a staff members mistake not policy you need the wipes for greasy chicken a it was a halal kfc think kosher targeted to muslim customers not a regular kfc b it was staff error isn t it rubbing alcohol the stuff that ll make you go blind you if you drink it wow they didn t tell them that the chicken is cooked in pig lard lmao never use the place so won t get rich on me i ll overlook it as long as they come through with those kentucky fried pork rinds they ve been planning had

i have some cash i want to send his way killing is proving to be a excellent career move for that p ssy 500k to rub our noses in this in justice what s the source i saw that earlier but just from a right wing crackpot so didn t know what to believe omg shut up sweet deray you re just so damn dumb you were one of those affirmative action hires weren t you sigh really don t they have a policy of not paying for interviews this couldn t b official what about the defense fund people donated to for wilson which exceeded 500k this is so disgusting bastard will have more now than he ever would ve as the popo damn shame what the actual unmitigated fuck that action also shows how corrupt the major news organizations are paying for a murderer s version of his crime are you serious smdh so does race baiting not just abc he shopped himself round to several of the big failstream media wankers ovr the wkend almost like he knew it was time between that and donations he s a fucking millionaire and conservatives don t understand why there s anger screw abc that s disturbing i hope people don t watch this bull no ratings for abc source the only one who can destroy your life is yourself get up and do something and stop complaining that goes for anyone if that s true boycott all abc shows if a fund is set up to support the browns in a civil suit against wilson ferguson pd then it would raise millions of dollars there is a way to make them feel our pain it is called boycott yea and some jerk wants to invite him to the wh to let him know we appreciate him you nitwits amped this non story up to ludicrous levels strategy gt emotions actually it was 513k and they had to sign notarized agreements promising not to give his location to anyone if he retracted they why did you need to mention his tweet at all we need to boycott this might seem like a strange question by where does officer wilson expect to work if they paid him it was too much i didn t watch it he will continue on his media tour as long as it remains profitable he s no good for anything else never was this country is literally built on amp thru the destruction of black lives that it continues is saddening maddening amp

the newsroom have no idea what their agenda is here i bet the browns did every one of their interviews absolutely free didn t they read it on the internet if so it must be true i bet not did u listen he s telling truth u just don t want to hear it wilson will be on channel tonight wonder what he ll get for that one no matter i wont be watching just ask zimmerman 1st its interviews for pay then the

we still don t know value thread human populations are not well mixed amp homogenous so calcs give likely upper bound q so what is herd immunity threshold hit for real pops a usually lower amp it depends on variation among individuals in things contact rates susceptibility infectiousness background if we know reproductive number r0 for pathogen in population herd immunity threshold hit for well mixed homogenous population is simply r0 note r0 varies w behavior host traits environment so differs over time amp space if some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected lowering hit note variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread if some aren t susceptible to infection that reduces hit if some people don t transmit that also reduces hit positive correlations among these traits if individuals w more contacts are more susceptible and infectious can make for very rapid changes in dynamics sadly not much empirical data on these correlations amp limited data on predictors of variation on susc amp infect however see paper by that is even better b c more general better data than science paper cited above fig shows how variation susc contacts affects hit f for r0 so hit f science paper link above also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces hit it considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w in each age group having more or fewer contacts the strange part is that it s not clear what source their age mixing data comes from the citation they give is not a published paper it s a link to a page w matlab files it s weird because there are several age mixing datasets out there can probably provide best ones the take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age i e not well mixed and w arbitrary differential activity contact rates w in ages can reduce hit for r0 from to the conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept not an actual estimate of the most likely value what i find puzzling is that this paper is in science it s a extremely simple modeling exercise with arbitrarily chosen parameter values it isn t as general as paper cited above and it s not clear it has any new empirical data many older papers say same thing paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity amp impacts on hit f based on data colored lines in figure in idealized population early vaccination to hit will prevent outbreak b c rt r0 s n so rt lt however an epidemic will overshoot hit amp infect larger fraction f of pop where f exp f r0 for r0 reasonable for covid19 in some pops hit and f these simple calculations amp flu data are what led to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that of pop would get infected without interventions most articles cited the but knew that i d like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity amp some are very indirect estimates but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial but serological data from nyc suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or r0 is much larger or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f i added horiz dashed line together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is lt r0 and epidemic overshoot lt f exp f r0 but by how much is still unknown ugh smartly gave a wide range in later interviews for fraction infected f w out interventions unfortunately uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for hit for pop amp it will vary among populations as does r0 the take home message is want to get to hit by vaccination not infection are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence say gt from the canonical immunity threshold aside from hiv or stis with highly stratified risk groups yes see link at end to interview with that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial did some work on this in or so also when i recall correctly a programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available this is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity i e a few important spreaders heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has how long it lasts not yet sadly without reading the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading unroll please salam please find the unroll here what is threshold for a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty amp talk to you soon what is this about

       " 'first what is a coronavirus ulmer this particular strain started in wuhan province it traveled from animals to humans she said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first panelists beaumont public health director sherry ulmer beaumont emergency management coordinator tim ocnashek bisd assistant superintendent of elementary education anita frank from beaumont psychiatric clinic jason mensah ulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in beaumont or jefferson county she said she doesn t want to downplay the flu with both viruses the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised we re fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu if we re familiar with it it s less scary to us she notes because covid is so new there s little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine ulmer says she doesn t know how many cases are in texas but mensah says there are ulmer said she knows percent of people who get coronavirus will just get essentially the common cold i m trying to get more info on this stat she s quoting i know thanks to i think that the study that showed percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia so mild is relative here ulmer said she s hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine she says that s why it s important to continue tried and true healthcare methods wash your hands stay home when you re sick clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays lysol clorox and are cdc approved to kill the virus we understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread he gives some facts he s heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction he s been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for days ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces the virus is transmitted person to person she says that can include being in close quarters with someone simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets that s why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing ulmer said the health department is putting together soemthing so people know what the next step is if jefferson county has a confirmed case i m going to use tim s first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling so tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures that includes limiting crowds increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary measures i would like to add as of friday the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds the comment was at this time danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken tim says we re not trying to scare people there s a lot of bad information out there he encourages people to get information only from reputable sources instead of looking at things on facebook or from friends and spreading it like it s a fact we would encourage people to be patient because it s a fluid situation feldshau he notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week however when advice was given to keep events small the church went to live streaming ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan and several times a year the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them we are as prepared as we can be with the information we re getting of course it s fluid but we re accustomed to these types of situations reiterating a point made previous people most at risk are those and older and those with preexisting conditions she said children diagnosed with coronavirus years and under are doing very well for our children it sounds like god has smiled on us now talking about flattening the curve people are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections this is not here today and gone tomorrow feldschau ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would tax our healthcare system should the city county get there it would have to look at alternative ways to treat people she didn t expand on what those alternatives are she said that s one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up i we know that you re coming the staff can be ready for you they can meet you outside they can give you a mask that s one way now we re trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future if we ever lose control we re going to have a serious problem from comment section on the video if this virus is just like the flu amp spreads like viruses do airborne i m not understanding the panic amp closure of so many things what is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don t do it for flu this seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments someone simply responded yassss and another said people don t know what

in few days wouldn t over toronto be a better expansion choice for where will this tor2 team play does this put the markham project back on the front burner east or west i don t know why they d send another team to toronto the broke the first one awful organization to me stupidity nhl in vegas won t work not enough talent for big expansion maybe two more teams in the west nhl dosent have enough

heißen will no stash on the lip million victims of which millions were jews there always hv bn fringe elements in every society ignoreable but islamic terrr nt ignoreable protected amp promotd by world msm you live in the us model of ulgham very good comparison i m not a crook excuse me for a moment checker s quit humping my leg now where was i yea mind your business canada eh yea they are identical idiot lmao lmao this book may enlighten you bird amp bird brain together again rt adolf hitler vs donald trump i m just seeing john cena breaking news john cena is a nazi and is gullible so he finally admits he is an immigrant too but he doesn t get it idiot legit had to just look in my philosophy book to remind myself what the teleological argument was maybe she ll vote bernie he s way better than trump he actually knows wtf he s doing unlike trumps sorry ass i found his hair growing on the roadside trumpus clumpus heil trump beware of haters adolf hitler vs donald trump jeetje sir how dare you defame the memory of my late brother in queerness al lewis grandpa munster by comparing vile ted cruz to him block for agree wholeheartedly awesome voting for the lesser of two evils has left the people dissatisfied its a damn scary thing blödsinn clinton cash get the book haha throw ted cruz in their too that guy is a psycho bahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa deep stuff there can t disagree with the first but the last for trump is bit of a stretch especially last one the nazis were socialists you have the wrong party actually trump has extra pro not a killer done right bahahahaha way to similar but followers are like s germany and they ridicule you if you disagree sound familiar omg yes trump boy schultz there s an even greater resemblance just below the tail trump may trigger third world war then jews were not blowing themselves up or scheming to kill germans this is false analogy or a joke at best well hilarious love it oh not only is it fair it needs some special attention before it comes to pass to many had to die trying to stop it before feel the bern should so be his entire campaign we can user this as an example for the teleological argument why compare them it wont sway trump voters they love their similarities one of first things president trump will do in is procecute crooked hillary lol since hitler won the office the natural corollary is that donald drumph will too he also spoke in complete sentences comprised of words with more than two syllables see ya also has bad hair days on a regular basis most of what is spoken on the media about is fake oh no trump is a new name of supreme god be carreful lol loool ewwwwww liz as the president would say you re a jack ass it s unfortunately a fake picture i just don t know what internment camp i have to report to when trump takes over my back is gonna hurt from bldg the wall too bahahaha yes its heartwarming that they still spend their lives trying to make things better for the rest of us when it costs them so dear hitler was elected as head of government u right you mean women like the terrorist don t support hitler amp trump politics but like to say jews are not what muslims are there are a lot of differences the purpose of software engineering is to control complexity not to create it zave america is america with the immigrants that started it the country belonged to the native indians took their land and made it usa on to a winner then but timing is off as the recession is over lol yup quite a few too but hitler fooled people and get elected by millions that like him and vote for him while trump eh oh my god lol i tried not to really he s a scary guy tratan de desprestigiarlo por ser el mas opcionado how many days is this love good for amazing had one on my wheel it was huge its all about him me me me what i say is right everyone else is wrong but hitler was a leftist socialist what s wrong why are you so worried even saudis think in the same way trump s an utter wanker luckly in the us he can fool only the gop faithful i hope can win over hillary easily and he is a better candidate suuport him have we listened to our politicians they use immigration x to get to power whipping up hatred to mask their incompetence jajajajajajaja reminds me of the beauty and the beast amp veterans live in ac rooms that s all so true rofl or does his hair look like the caterpillar get a spring in your step with the trumpalin the thing you got wrong was the title it s not trump v hitler it s trump amp hitler im no bleeding heart liberal but hate breeds hate omfg and both made distinctive but terrible hair choices i feel like south park did an episode addressing this very issue these shoes are by gucci and retail over i think they look like donald trump s hair gruesome ट रम प न गलत परम पर श र करक अम र क र ष ट रपत क च न व क भ रत क च न व स भ ग द बन द य if hitler had won paeans would have been sung for him it s winner takes all aren t they wild free range

say block them easy as that patética comparación rara en una persona tan aguda como el sr lucien no tiene ni pies ni cabeza trump is an entertainment personality that exercises his freedom to say whatever he wants hitler murdered millions lol donolf hump wow we ve a new low when germany is calling us fascist done your point is what first you must be a liberal to have that comparison and second you must be a liberal or a rino gt do you happen to know this veterans name i like rump too what a load of bollocks hillary trump looks like voldemort from the first harry potter movie imo trump s personality is closer to mussolini s everyone is too stupid to realize the difference they make up whatever bullshit they want to racial homogenization better for usa abound the now replace donald trump with narendra modi what a truly cynical butt facetrump is his butt facedness is so great it threatens to pull earth from it s gravitational rotation the donald as blob fish just saying but remember hitlet finally came to power they totally do hard to choose this guy scares the hell out of me million people would beg to differ with you have you ever been to a holocaust museum he looks

and shooting i wonder why protect 2nd amend correlation is causation terror will continue to reign as long as good men do nothing obama has to be a plant to destroy america did they change the definition of mass shootings i m sure this will be labeled workplace violence i d love a source on that also wasn t the awb during clinton and bush2 are you trying to say it s reagan s fault his legacy will be alot of blood shed at home i am sure the hateful divisive us vs them rhetoric from wasn t a factor sarc off obama hate race religion gender himself just like the stock market does better with dem president fact this is merely coincidental alleen de laatste doet er iets aan dat is verschil en media duikt op alles what is the appropriate response to sabotage lol well maduro fidel obama has encouraged mass shootings by politicizing them also by being useless defending against terrorism if that is true that is a crazy statistic of these were work related violence enter in causalties of war may even the playing field this happens when congress blocks rational gun control mass shootings boost gun sales amp lobbyists the entitlement of the right have their beliefs and position questioned and they lose their shit all a bunch of bs most of which were in gun free zones the establishment of no gun zones created this disaster maybe they aren t totally accurate but we weren t having these kinds of convos pre 2008z links to democrats and a islam are rampant see the pattern dems drive people to madness killers they are because that evil sick funk muslim potus likes it hope they can kill as many people as possible by doing a quick magazine change its hard not to give excuses to anyone but social cohesion must be part of it obama divides nice visual he s a muslim and yet liberals continue to support our dick tator in chief this is not coincidental but orchestrated correlation causation how about the numbers in the workforce breakdown too ovamit s climate change disarm america and let the terrorists rain bullets and bombs thank you for this i was going to look this up i knew it was much higher but had no idea it was this high it s still all the fault of pres bush out of curiosity what s the source of those numbers wow what variables are you comparing statistics are pointless without meaning p value less than i believe there s a significant difference the common denominator is obama when it comes to death in america when he is gone we can begin to rebuild usa so it s obama s fault people are insane very interesting a breakdown by race might explain some things i m thinking poor real economy colliding with entitled kids social media an abundance of a holes why the increase under o o amp his injustice dept will not pursue death penalty for punishment of criminals what analysis cause there wasn t much social media like there is today global warming has gotten worse i m sure that s why obama s number is so high right what would they do if we said we want to keep our guns to combat and the madness it s creating do not be deceived there are possible motives gun control police state obama is bad omen a pertinent comment on the increased violence under an islamic inclined president by the numbers islamist muslims kill obama faith deadlier then obama what s your point not surprising those presidents had a gun control act which was struck down in no cultural rot amp o works to disarm law abiding citizens while making others soft targets hey i m starting to see a trend there with those numbers can you spell democrap according to liberal math there s been this year so it s even worse if you add murdered feelings more than an omen he is a puppet of evil pure n simple step it up ronald oops the relevant number gun homicides annually dropping steadily ok but what are the golf handicaps of each president only stats this idiot is interested in i m waiting to hear pres obama spin the mass shooting stats on his watch as caused by almost all after changes in expanded definition and increase in more restrictive laws thanks libs i ll keep mine thanks boy this info is enlightening the most divisive president in us history has quite a legacy with this stat is there a democrat problem go back to your safe zone we ll take care of everything as usual seriously we have three guns and i don t ammo is expensive wow it s interesting how global warming has driven islamic terrorists in america amp our president mad right on plan to destabilize the nation interesting since reagans time the numbers have unfortunately increase why channa when you call the police do you tell them to not bring their guns don t be a hypocrite not over yet still counting impenetrable lawgic this isnt evidence it s correlation that s a pretty crazy sad stat reagan should have attempted assassination hope and change political based accidental planned makes me wanna go buy another guns w ammo look like a cannon coming never let a crisis go to waste lol so what are you saying if mccain romney were president the number would be much less link to the source of these stats wow the mass killer prez for sure there s b0 s legacy

takeout food wrappers who picks up the bags he leaves in the hallway is it safe to watch press conferences i think i had this in december or a strain of it and i had already gotten flu shot and pneumonia shot as well maybe next time thanks now you made the diabetic want some frosting i found it unsettling that while talking to dr lapook you took another alcohol drink in the middle of his explanation of potential life saving drugs this was disrespectful and inappropriate do you have some drinking problem where you must drink while broadcasting your show fever dry cough a whole pint container as long as it s the whipped kind nutella instead ask him why i am starting to resemble my sourdough starter great show tonight great guest thank you some body said we have to wash our hands for minutes is it right youtube not showing notifications for ur videos i m just going to assume the answer to the frosting one is three or four tubs thank you if you eat the frosting while standing

fly sort of like replacing an airplane engine in flight i miss the live audience a craving sweets b the whole thing you re welcome why was dr lapook evasive in so many of his answers example when can we hug again answer hugging is good for you if viewers want evasion we get that with trump s press conferences how about a good honest i don t know unless this was satire it was highlight of my week i shave on wednesdays what s your highlight bothered me he said the drug trump was pushing like a dealer with no scientific proof and condemned by the ama this dr said was part of the standard protocol in treating patients maybe this is a new york thing i as a patient would like the right to refuse it very good questions about covid19 thank you for bringing drlapook to your program i am getting tired of cooking but i have been afraid of ordering now i feel a little more confident about deliveries in a graham cracker i would like to say as much as it takes and don t forget the tall glass of

across the airwaves i was able to watch sam hunt and dave matthews in my chair g i jon has done so well that i couldn t think of anything to ask him he couldn t be betta i have a question for dr

doc how to fix this dr my husband snores can i get the corona virus if he breathes on me thank you from for letting the world know how is the worst in history keep up your good work stephen as much homemade buttercream frosting you can stomach before vomiting x nay on canned symptoms many cough fever body aches out of breath or none of the above cannot really know without a test everyone needs to be tested dear doctor would it make stephen and some first responders happier if he would invite them to zoom skype in to be his audience he could hear their responses and they would get a sweet preview of the show win win great interview you may find this interesting more importantly what was looking at up and to his right over and over during that interview a clock another samurai sword espn highlights of the game vs the rockets where he and barkley got ejected would love to see john and the band do a song on zoom miss seeing the whole band stephen thank you for the laughs each night you are one of the few bright lights these days enjoying a late show really like the home show and can hear and enjoy the musicians so much better cbs is doing a great job to keep this all going forward these are important things to find out on your show you ve mentioned you miss the audience would it help at all if your viewers recorded their reactions sent them in were complied together in file then played over the show taping i mean i know it wouldn t help during recording since it s not live but at least you d know how people reacted maybe i can confirm from personal testing the answer to the second question is more than jar aaand now i want to instacart a frosting after just a few weeks our skies are clearer and the water is cleaner maybe we could plan to return to a different and better normal and there are dolphins swimming in the canals in venice that one really impressed me and i saw the pictures watching you change into pajamas for cate blanchett was

quality of immune system or it is harmful in this case of covid_19 thanks for sharing in iran we need the urgent intervention of the world health organization to prevent disaster this government has no crisis management at all i am absolutely appalled by the lack of measures put in place at train stations and airports across europe strict checks should be in place at every large city for both

it can be transmitted through aerosols if you re in the same room as some1 amp they are breathing the same air you can get the virus masks amp eyewear are key it can be transmitted through urine amp
