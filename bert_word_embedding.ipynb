Not to mention why it was essential for the military academies to play their football games...   oil trumps life it probably depends on how the website maint contracts were set-up and where they're feds or contractors running them.

Shutdown shouldn't happen, though.  my website costs more or takes more time to shut down rather than just let it stay up! A missing child alert system sounds pretty fucking essential to me. well of course... This is part of the smoke and mirrors. What can we shut down that will piss off the most people?   They do have bandwidth &amp; electricity costs. Plus many gov sites run on AWS cloud at hourly rates. I suppose we should simply let YOU decide what's essential and what's not? Fuck you, dude.

Throw all the bums out!!!!  Pissed off and Mad about it. I have the same question about Camp David staying open.Because websites don’t just run on their own.  Someone has to be back behind the curtain or it just shuts off right?    probably fuel economy site has a different funding source. Car companies, perhaps? One has to do with money the other just has to human life. We all know what rules politics nowadays. or why Michelle Obamas \"let's move\" food nanny website is still up?  Excellent question! Only 17% of the USG is actually shut down. But Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move\" site is up and running. Almost other no Fed site up.   it all comes down to when funding was awarded. If the contract to run a site is already paid, it will keep running.

      "\n",
      "What is a coronavirus?\n",
      "It is a novel virus named for the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The coronavirus can infect both animals and people and canand people and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses from the common cold to lung lesions and pneumonia.\n",
      "How contagious is the virus?\n",
      "It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces.The pathogen can travel through the air, enveloped in tiny respiratory droplets that are produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes.Where has the virus spread?\n",
      "The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 89,700 inat least 67 countries and more than 3,000 have died. The spread has slowed in China, but is picking up speed in Europe and the United States.\n",
      "What symptoms should I look out for?\n",
      "Symptoms, which can take between two to 14 days to appear, include fever, coughand difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, but people may be able to pass on the virus even before they develop symptoms.\n",
      "How do I keep myself and others safe?\n",
      "Washing your hands frequently is the mostthe most important thing you can do, along with staying at home when you’re sick and avoiding touching your face.\n",
      "How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n",
      "Keep a 30-day supply of essential medicines. Get a flu shot. Have essential household items on hand.Have a support system in place for elderly family members.\n",
      "What if I’m traveling?\n",
      "The C.D.C. has advised against all non-essential travel to South Korea, China, Italy and Iran. And the agency has warned older and at-risk travelers to avoid Japan.How long will it take to develop a treatment or vaccine?\n",
      "Several drugs are being tested, and some initial findings are expected soon. A vaccine to stop the spread is still at least a year away.\n",

Younger individuals should not be worried about the virus.Of greater concern to younger individuals, and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of COVID-19 in this coming fall.

      " 4.) The actions mandated by public health officials, schools, and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction.The prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals, hospitals, and public health organizations treat individuals, but also decreases risk of mutations in COVID-19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of COVID-19 in the fall able to severelyaffect all individuals as the more COVID-19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation (from perspective of the virus) is to arise. (6) The stopping of the spread of COVID-19 now is CRUCIAL to preventing the spread later, and for protecting the elderly,immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing conditions. It should also be noted that not extending the course of the COVID-19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace asa result of financial need leading to increased spread.

      "There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.  new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.  hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?\n",
      "No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.  an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus?\n",
      "UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.  effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus?\n",
      "Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.  spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus?\n",
      "No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body.Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.  vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?\n",
      "No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.  regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?\n",
      "No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.  eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus?\n",

      "No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.  there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus?\n",
      "To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care.Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.

What are the chances of contracting the virus is at all she was infected doc? But it said the virus can survive on plastic and paper surfaces for up to 2 to 3 days sir.

But retailers are still not allowed to sell cooked food during lock down? Of course not.  if it can be found on an object surface, what can stop it to be found on food packaging? my minister say\"there are no cases confirmed from food packaging\" from the cases that are currently confirmed is there a method to test where,how and when they have occurred?

Gauteng needs total shutdown Please instruct retailers to issue their staff with face masks. We cannot stay 1m away from cashiers when paying!

Go to Chick fil a instead, we need to stop changing our way of life to appease everyone with a quirk.  Let them lick their left hands then.  good heavens-what a bunch of freaks. Congrats on your 250 tweet!   Is this in the UK? If this shit comes to US I will NEVER eat  again.  KFC is most likely only a Subsidiary Franchise when ye consider ruling factors of th %s.    Fortunately Tweeting seems to be turning the tide.  Because KFC know their UK market. KFC is a business.  Bye bye Ms. American pie...  go to chik-filet .. popeyes, churches, or a local deli of some type, probably better anyway!  If only!  \n",

Why are there Islam-controlled UK Cities?  then the Muslims go home and drink in private hypocrites to the max   Islam bans drinking alcohol, do KFC provide wipes to suck on? this is a joke, right? this stupidity has got to stop  Don't use a wipe - use a muslim? Or have I read this wrong? :-) Which customers do they need the most,Muslims or everyone else that has been their customers for decades &amp; never burned one. this isn't true, FYI. In case anyone is still interested in what's factual. Agree.  stop the EVIL religion &amp; government via  &amp; . poor ole colonel is no doubt rolling in his grave   BAN KFC AND CANCEL PASSPORTS OF ALL BRITISHERS WHO DO NOT BOOZE  no more KFC!  Place is garbage food anyhow   &lt;&lt; See what you have done. Not listening to customers breaks balls. Getting it yet?.  Easily the stupidest story I've read in awhile. Ppl are clueless. Alcohol is essential for disinfection. FFS  satire?  Or are  Just thick? Eat mor Chickin  !!  No keep going and maby you get behead. So go support them  No more Kenfucky fried chicken for me!

Kill them economically .  I thought Muslims don't eat pork? whats with the wipes? I like there biscuits....  Pass the damn bacon!!  If the Muslims are idiotic enough to suck on the wipes, it's THEIR problem, not KFC's.  well said And how come they are NEVER offended by the benefits they claim from us infidels.  ---&gt;  &lt;---- CAN  It! Ban muslims if they don't like what we have, WELL they can just move back to the hell hole they came from! R Shut up!  That seems very extreme. Diverse cultures have an option to partake or abstain..if U disagree- don't use them. People who eat in KFC's are the sort of people who make love to vacuum cleaners.     read the article properly,it was a member of staff.. American style chicken offends me...  Has to be British or is like sponsoring terrorists  HAVE YOU NOTICED THE LACK OF SKIN ON CHICKEN PORTIONS IN YOUR LOCAL SMKT.?  FFS, the KFCs in Mid East give out wet wipes (in my limited experience of Mid East KFCs). UK gone mad  Priv. corp so not a big deal in my mind. They need to accommodate the market share they want.  Check out Chick-fil-A must better than KFC What's next? A Burqa for The Colonel? No female employees? Why not tofu chicken so as not to offend PETA?   - yes! Stamp it out now or it really will be too late. It's a terrible story, it really is. I never saw animal rights activists protest Halal - the most cruel method to kill animals/birds for meat  Dumb question:  Why do Muslims hate alcohol?  ban it in hospitals too, horrible stuff, tried all sorts of mixers with it too  the religion of  sucks. so does  and   there's alcohol in them ? They give them away free.   Demand Bacon at KFC!     Kentucky Fried Cr*p! fed up of having other religions rammed down my throat if I wanted to be a Muslim I would become one. KFC off my list then cheers  I am an American offended by Obama  Just how ridiculous can we get! This all pisses me off.  Tell them to go home if they don't like how we live.  (I'm vegie anyhow )  Erm... I think Islamic world pioneered use of alcohol for medical purposes. It's consumption that's forbidden.   You guys are turning into France. Wipes are not required to be used, are they? Smile, tell the fussies where the dry napkins are, and Who can I help next?  the once great British empire will be dirt roads and mud huts in a hundred years, if not sooner.  It's not consumable alcohol? ie Ethanol. What's next screenwash?  That's right Patriot. We need to let the Corporates who really is in charge in America; that being We the American People.  A Muslim leader said banning of wipes was bizarre and KFC have apologised so no need to stop visiting.  is disgusting anyway.  That's the main reason to ban them.  dafuq? They don't even know the diff between rubbing alcohol and drinking alcohol? RL Idiocracy. What kind of drivel is this you're spouting?  There he boycotted alcohol wipes zibidi get deported! not aware of that religion from the   Thats exactly why the problem exists because people have, I for one have had enough. When in Rome  stupid If an alcohol wipe offends then I guess they should just use their shit covered hands to eat the halal crap.  It already is, when the likes of Anjem Chowdry freely roam the streets of Londonistan!   why boycott them over a staff members mistake? Not policy?  you need the wipes for greasy chicken.  (a) It was a halal KFC (think kosher), targeted to Muslim customers, not a regular KFC; (b) it was staff error  Isn't it rubbing alcohol?  The stuff that'll make you go blind you if you drink it?  Wow!!! They didn't tell them that the chicken is cooked in pig lard???? LMAO   Never use the place so won't get rich on me!!!!  I'll overlook it as long as they come through with those Kentucky fried pork rinds they've been planning.    had FREE  food at the KC on Saturday, avoided that Hal Al shite! This is stupid though.

For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.

It seems like a tactic to scare ppl into wearing masks. Yeah those were the elements that made me think that. BTW speaking of your contempt for epidemiologists there is something very interesting going on that they need to get into the bottom off ... It is not just mask compliance. I have noticed in NJ increasing socialization and crowding in public places as the state has reopened. Yet we don't detect a pickup in cases.

Don't fall into the narrative trap. Help spread the truth  No it hasn't there is no proof regarding 5G  You are absolutely correct.. there is no proof its dangerous or safe. The lack of safety testing concerns me.. I know we all have mobile phones, wifi routers, microwaves and several other devices that transmit some kind of radio waves but 5G is at least 10 times the strength.  And is a radio signal which can do absolutely no harm to you  Can you back that up  Yes I can considering I work in the field myself  Do you.. so is it true they operate at 60ghz and above. The same frequency as a military ray gun  No thats a myth we have no where that came from. 5G can carry a frequency up to 300ghz but the frequency range that will be used for 5G will be between 3.3ghz and 4.2ghz  Let me put it another way i am assuming you have WiFi at home. And during this lockdown have you noticed it being a bit slower than normal that's due to the volume of people logging on which in turns makes it slower. 5G removes that  I understand that the wifi is slower at the moment and if everything goes back to normal, it will return to normal. The 4G on my network hasn't really changed.. I also don't believe that 5G is Covid. It is just coincidental that this is happening at the same time.  4G runs around 2.8 ghz while I do agree why do we need it now we do need it in the future because of the improvement in speed and download time.\n",

      "Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.\n",
      "Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n",
      "Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n",
      "Why?When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n",
      "Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\n",
      "Why?Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n",
      "Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.\n",
      "Why?Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.Follow the directions of your local health authority.\n",
      "Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\n",
      "Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have++diabetes, heart or lung disease.\n",
      "Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.\n",

Now if you can get your fellow GOPers to do the same maybe we can start to get out of this mess:       Deaths are making a comeback and may follow these recent hospitalizations.  Hopefully not.  Herd immunity is not a goal. 40% of SARS survivors still getting treatment 5 years later. We don't even know if immunity is a thing.      The goal is to stomp out the virus. Come on. The goal isn't to infect billions of people around the globe.  You want to talk draining our savings?

      "The main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause. The first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium, while Sars and Mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity.How do viruses work?\n",
      "A virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate. It enters the cell through binding with receptors and “reprogrammes it” to make copies of itself, working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body.The virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen, but that's why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people. Washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection.There are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners. But this has not been systematically studied, so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty.How deadly is the new coronavirus compared to Sars, Mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold?\n",
      "We cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak, because a lot of mild cases are missed.Also, with Covid-19, some people can be asymptomatic - meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mortality rate for influenza is 0.1 per cent, but since Covid-19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal.It is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications, influenza kills 500,000 people. Compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses, the mortality rate for Sars-Cov-2 is higher.Although compared to Sars (9.6 per cent) and Mers (34.4 per cent), Covid-19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread, making the total number of deaths larger.Can summer, or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus?\n",
      "For some respiratory viruses this does happen. Not because of the temperature, but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings. In this case, it is still premature to say.\n",

      "When this pandemic infected 26 of the population worldwide, it made me fear for my life. But now? It infected more than a hundred thousands of people, millions of people to be exact. What is “COVID-19” anyway? It is a crisis that we all should take seriously.  pandemic, I became productive. I learned how to decipher codes, I get to watch a lot of animes and read many books. I am happy because I get to spend more time with my family like, watching movies, eating together and talked and talked about everything.This pandemic started and the true face of the people also started to unmask. Some families doesn’t have a proper home, some doesn’t have the stable job to provide the need for their family, and some doesn’t have the privilege to protect themselves during this pandemic.What about them? There are people that are hoarding the necessities, to what? To benefit you from preventing the virus? To re-sell it at a higher price? These people didn’t even think about the people who doesn’t have enough money to buy enough necessities for their family.  be honest, I got mad at them. During this pandemic, I also realized how bad our government is. The president didn’t even bother to tell us the plan at an early time, instead he ordered the police and soldiers to kill everyone not obeying the rules. I mean?????  people not obeying the rules are hungry, they are waiting for the relief goods that was supposed to be distributed as soon as possible but nothing was distributed.  also realized that no matter how bad and irresponsible you are, if you have a position at the government and if you are rich, you can wander freely everywhere, spreading the virus and still be given compassion that you don’t deserve.  pandemic made me aware of the issues of what’s really happening. It angers me a lot, to be honest because if you don’t have the privilege, you are going to be ignored like a pest. That’s how dirty the government works.We already have the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia with minimal testing. Without testing, we’re acting blind &amp; exposing the vulnerable— old, poor, and the jobless. I think that there will be no choice but to extend this lockdown.  should all cooperate during this lockdown. The government should provide our needs and necessities to prevent people from going outside. We can overcome this situation by cooperating and puting our faith to God and the frontliners.  also should give our biggest salute to our frontliners, not only they are giving their absolute best, but they are staking their lives as well.

Residual panic will no doubt help with sales.        Agree Meredith. But when herd immunity takes over, it will have fewer hosts.

Actually it was 513K and they had to sign notarized agreements promising not to give his location to anyone.  if he retracted- they WHY did you need to mention his tweet at all? we need to boycott     This might seem like a strange question, by where does Officer Wilson expect to work   If they paid him $1 it was too much. I didn't watch it.  He will continue on his media tour as long as it remains profitable. He's no good for anything else, never was. This country is literally built on &amp; thru the destruction of Black lives. That it continues is saddening, maddening, &amp; unsurprising.  He is now a success to the Klan, and the man he married.“: Y'all, I just read that ABC paid Darren Wilson $500K for the interview.\"  shame on you !!!! FWIW  is a parody account for a character on HBO's the Newsroom.  Have no idea what their agenda is here. I bet the Browns did every one of their interviews absolutely free, didn't they??  Read it on the Internet? IF so, it must be true!  . I bet not. Did u listen?  He's telling truth. U just don't\n",
      "want to hear it!  Wilson will be on channel 7  8 tonight. Wonder what he'll get for that one. No matter ... I wont be watching. Just ask Zimmerman! 1st its interviews for pay then the gun show circuit for autographs for pay!  Add ABC to my boycott list along with Walmart, Olive Garden, FOX pukes..err news, Koch Industrie,Monsanto. Arggh!  White men get paid whether they do good or bad. White supremacy: Rule No. 1. they ran out of animals..now they hunt us  not black, but I believe it is wrong for him to get paid for this, wrong for ABC to offer. How can anyone do this? sorry 4 all false it didn't even come from a reliable source  And he wound up with the same amount in donations. Sickening  Check that. abc doesn't pay for interviews beyond hotel and transportation. what????  Got a link?    where on ABC? If that's true he got a paid vacation and a million dollar bonus. Are you serious???      Something in my mind is saying that, ThaT, is illegal in itself.   aka; Fortune Hunters. vs Infamy.  Again, who says a black man's life is worthless! Ka-CHING!.

Well when he sues the NYT, Sharpton and the rest I hope he bankrupts them all is it confirmed? really? i read they didn't pay him anything BOYCOTT ABC AS WELL !   Just  a Black Person. whatever happened to not being able to profit from your crime? what  Wilson's dfenc hinges on \"I was afraid for my life\" but he sd in  intv that he was worried \"legally.\" Liar. Murderer  Wow! That's so fucked up.   Good time to Boycott, Divest &amp; Sanction. Never let  rest. Never. who's reporting that?\n",

Will give it up now.  it’s a special if that’s any consolation.  Stop with this bullshit. That's the annual special. They do similar every year. It's not the laatest mag.  sigh  oh ye gods...is nothing safe anymore from superstitious garbage?  IT WILL COOL ITSELF!!!  ITS CALLED A CYCLE!!!

Is that genuine?  Is there....something wrong with doing an issue on fun paranormal stories? Not seeing the issue here. (no pun intended)  didn't they do this anyway? I'm pretty sure they did this a lot even before.  This is nothing new, NatGeo does one of these every year. What no tits? It's says display until January '16 oh for f sake! No. next month: Freddie Starr ate my hamster...  Ugh, I used to love reading those as a kid. Disgusting.

National Geographic is now dead to me...   I had no idea Murdoch owns that now.  :(. As pointed out by many, NatGeo has a supernatural special issue every year. This is it. It's shelved with \"Specials.\"  HOW IS THIS NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MATERIAL?! No it didn't. That cover appeared in 2014 and was a special issue for non-subscribers. time for another boycott  ...I'm in the know  hahahahahaha funny but sad.  it's a special edition and nobody is sure if this came out before or after Murdoch bought the magazine. Well, mixed reviews on the pseudoscience of supernatural in this copy.  don't get it  WHAT?!This has nothing to do with Murdoch and you know it. I can't stand the man either.\n",

RIP National Geographic - Sadly will now never purchase again due to ownership Sorry, no  answer is 42   well you don't want people documenting the beauty of the natural world.

What is 'social distancing' and what can I do if I'm not able to be six feet apart?  .  10. Should I wear a face covering in public? Will it protect me from getting COVID-19?            COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets from person-to-person contact or through touching surfaces that have viral particles on them and then touching your face or mouth.               COVID-19 can live on surfaces for a variety of different times so that’s why it’s so important to do frequent handwashing for at least 20seconds and disinfecting surfaces with Cleaning products that are known to kill the virus.               Social distancing and physical separation by at least 6 feet or 1 meter is vital to making sure that we limit viral spread. When we employ these recommendations fewer people become infected and therefore cannot go on to infect others.                What is currently known is spread through droplets (from coughing or sneezing) which can get into mucous membranes of the eye, mouth &amp; nose if the infected person is close-by or drops on a surface and introduced into these mucous membranes with our hands when we touch the surface\n",

This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.

      "   What is humorous about herd immunity?Florida Gov  says state officials are making PSAs targeting younger Floridians who have let their guard down abt spread of COVID-19. Median age of coronavirus cases in Broward is now 33 yrs old. In Duval, 30. In Hillsborough Co, it’s 31. In Seminole, it’s 26 yrs old    And we achieve herd immunity before the fall flu season.   Super funny til someone you know gets it and dies.   Not a damn thing; it's deadly serious. A lot of people would have to die in short order to get there quickly. You need 60-70% to achieve. I frankly don't feel like sacrificing a large percentage of people over 60 to do it.    Data is showing that the best way to avoid infecting the at-risk 60+ population is don’t put COVID patients in nursing homes. The median age infected in the counties listed were all below 35. That’s exactly where you want the immunity to build.\n",

      "For asking that question, , you will be told that you are saying Covid-19 is 'just like the flu'. It will be a lie. But it is the lie invariably told about anyone who asks about govt response to previous high fatalities from flu complications. Why do govt supporters lie?   Copied from the ONS site today: \"In Week 13, 18.8% of all deaths mentioned “Influenza or Pneumonia”, COVID-19, or both. In comparison, for the five-year average, 19.6% of deaths mentioned “Influenza and Pneumonia”.\"  So less deaths from all 3 combined so far this year.  It puts different people in hospital compared with flu. The data are clear on this.   They also said: \"“Influenza and Pneumonia” has been included for comparison, as a well-understood cause of death involving respiratory infection that is likely to have somewhat similar risk factors to COVID-19.\"   Key words - similar risk factors.

      "A: *Usually* lower &amp; it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things: 1) contact rates; 2) susceptibility; 3) infectiousness.Background: If we know reproductive number R0 for pathogen in population, herd immunity threshold (HIT) for WELL-MIXED HOMOGENOUS population is simply 1-1/R0. \n",
      "(Note R0 varies w/ behavior, host traits, environment so differs over time&amp;space).1) If some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected, lowering HIT. (note: variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread).\n",
      "2) If some aren't susceptible to infection that reduces HIT. \n",
      "3)If some people don't transmit that also reduces HIT.Positive correlations among these traits - if individuals w/ more contacts are more susceptible and infectious - can make for very rapid changes in dynamics. Sadly not much empirical data on these correlations &amp; limited data on predictors of variation on susc. &amp; infect.However, see paper by  that is even better (b/c more general, better data) than Science paper cited above. Fig shows how variation susc, contacts affects HIT, f, for R0=3; so HIT=0.66, f = 0.94.\n",
      "  paper (link above) also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces HIT. It considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w/in each age group having more or fewer contacts.The strange part is that it's not clear what source their age-mixing data comes from. The citation they give is NOT a published paper - it's a link to a page w/ Matlab files. It's weird because there are several age-mixing datasets out there.  can probably provide best onesThe take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age (i.e. NOT well-mixed) and w/ arbitrary differential \"activity\" (contact rates) w/in ages can reduce HIT for R0=2.5 from 0.6 to 0.43.  conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept, not an actual estimate of the most likely value.  I find puzzling is that this paper is in Science. It's a extremely simple modeling exercise, with arbitrarily chosen parameter values. It isn't as general as  paper cited above, and it's not clear it has any new empirical data. Many older papers say same thing. paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity &amp; impacts on HIT, f based on data (colored lines in figure).  idealized population, early vaccination to HIT will prevent outbreak b/c Rt=R0*S/N so Rt&lt;1. However, an epidemic will overshoot HIT &amp; infect larger fraction f of pop where f=1-exp(-(f*R0)). \n",
      "For R0=2.5 (reasonable for COVID19 in some pops), HIT=0.6, and f = 0.89.These simple calculations &amp; flu data are what led  to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40-70% of pop would get infected without interventions. Most articles cited the 70% \n",
      "*BUT*  knew that...\n",

      ", uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility/infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for HIT for 1 pop &amp; it will vary among populations (as does R0). The take home message is want to get to HIT by vaccination NOT infection. Are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence (say &gt; 10%) from the canonical immunity threshold (aside from HIV or STIs with highly stratified risk groups)?\n",
      "\n",
      " Yes. See link at end to interview with  that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial.  did some work on this in 2007 or so also when I recall correctly: “\"A programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available.\"  This is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity (i.e. a few important spreaders; heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial).  Do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has, how long it lasts?  Not yet, sadly!  without reading: the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading.   unroll please Salam, please find the unroll here: : What is  threshold for ? A topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty &amp;…  Talk to you soon.   \"What is this about nerd immunity?\"  Assumptions about heterogeneity are just that, assumptions. But there is plenty of convincing evidence that slow down in spread is strongly linked to lockdowns; despite high levels of infection. Thus heterogeneity is likely less than the models predict. \n",

      "Beaumont Public Health Director Sherry Ulmer\n",
      "Beaumont Emergency Management Coordinator Tim Ocnashek\n",
      "BISD Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education Anita Frank\n",
      "From Beaumont Psychiatric Clinic, Jason MensahUlmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in Beaumont or Jefferson County.She said she doesn't want to downplay the flu. With both viruses, the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised.\n",

      "\"We're fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu.\"\n",
      "\"If we're familiar with it, it's less scary to us.\"She notes because COVID-19 is so new, there's little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine.Ulmer says she doesn't know how many cases are in Texas, but Mensah says there are 51.\n",

      "Ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get (essentially) the common cold.I'm trying to get more info on this stat she's quoting. I know (thanks to  I think) that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia.\n",

He gives some facts he's heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction. He's been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing, lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days.Ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces. The virus is transmitted person-to-person. She says that can include being in close quarters with someone, simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets.That's why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing.Ulmer said the health department is putting together \"soemthing\" so people know what the next step is if Jefferson County has a confirmed case.(I'm going to use Tim's first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling.)\n",

They can meet you outside, they can give you a mask ... that's one way now we're trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1/2as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus.\" 2/2Feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now, but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future.\n",

If they cough or sneeze without covering their mouths, or cover their mouths without washing hands after --&gt; and then touch you, or a door knob, or gas pump, or bag of chips that you then touch, it is transmitted.

People dealing with that stuff need to be good with washing their hands I made a post on FB about the different ways our body’s react to pathogens. I’ll tag you.

Can be handled if KHL stops taking guys. Las Vegas doesn't make sense, they've been trying to build a new arena for two decades to no avail, and 2nd Toronto team??

Really?  do you have some sort of inside knowledge that this could be possible?Otro equipo de Seattle para  RT : NHL expansion – four teams 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas Imagine new Toronto plays old TO in a Stanley Cup Final and the Leafs choke. Riots bigger than Vancouver would ensue 1.4b per team or for all 4? where do expansion fees come from though? Owners? Ticket prices? Congrats on your 250 tweet!   BY 2017? Are you gonna change your mind or telling that its not what your really said in few days? Wouldn't  over Toronto be a better expansion choice for ? where will this TOR2 team play? Does this put the Markham project back on the front burner? East or west?  I don't know why they'd send another team to Toronto. The broke the first one. Awful organization. to me, stupidity. Nhl in Vegas won't work. not enough talent for big expansion. Maybe two more teams in the west. NHL dosent have enough personal So no Eastern conference teams will be relocating?  Will there be a new realignment so that each conference has 17 teams?  I predict Las Vegas will have the best home record in the league....they did in the ECHL at least cc  “: NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees”Hmm.

      "\n",
      "Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens. They have been known to cause a variety of disorders in humans, from the common cold to the more severe Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified in emerging clusters of pneumonia (lung infection) cases in Wuhan, China.\n",
      "The virus was previously termed “nCoV-2019”. At the beginning of 2020, the virus was officially named SARS-CoV-2, due to its similarities to the previousSARS-CoV. The disease, as a whole, was then officially termed by the WHO as Coronavirus Disease 2019, or “COVID-19”.sneezes near other people, or when a person is in close contact with a sick person (within about 6 feet or 2 meters).What are the symptoms of COVID-19?\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms usually start a few days after a person is infected with the virus. But in some people, it can take even longer for symptoms to appear, thus the symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms can include:• Fever\n",
      "• Cough\n",
      "• Trouble breathing • Feeling tired\n",
      "• Muscle aches\n",
      "Most people have mild symptoms. Some people have no symptoms at all. But in other people, COVID-19 can lead to serious problems like pneumonia, not getting enough oxygen, or even death.This is more common in people who are older or have other health problems.When should I see a doctor?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have a fever, cough, or trouble breathing and might have been exposed to COVID-19, call 937 (The Saudi MOH Service Center) immediately.\n",
      "You might have been exposed if either of the following happened within the last 14 days:• You lived in, or traveled to, an area where lots of people have the virus – the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has information about which areas are affected. This can be found on their website:  ncov/travelers/index.html• You had close contact with a person who has the virus – This generally means being within about 6 feet of the person.\n",
      "If your symptoms are not severe, it is best to call your doctor, nurse, or clinic before you go in. They can tell you what to do and where to go.If you do need to go to the clinic or hospital, you will need to put on a face mask. The staff might also have you wait someplace away from other people.\n",

      "\n",
      "Most people with COVID-19 have only mild illness and can rest at home until they get better. If you have a more severe illness, you might need to stay in the hospital, possibly in the intensive care unit (also called the \"ICU\").There is no specific treatment for the infection, but the doctors and nurses in the hospital can monitor and support your breathing and other body functions; and make you as comfortable as possible, this is done through multiple ways, including external oxygen(e.g. oxygen mask), a ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe), and/or medication.Can COVID-19 be prevented?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are things you can do to reduce your chances of getting COVID-19:\n",
      "• Wash your hands with soap and water often. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going tothe bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.\n",
      "o If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.• Avoid touching your face (including your eyes, mouth, and nose) with your hands\n",
      "• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash, and wash your\n",
      "hands immediately after (as specified above).\n",
      "• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects andsurfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.\n",
      "• CDC does not recommend that people who are well and healthy wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.\n",
      "o Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 tohelp prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone who has COVID-19.\n",
      "• Stay home when you are sick, and call your doctor if you think you have been exposed to COVID- 19.• Try to stay away from people who have any symptoms of the infection.\n",
      "• Some experts recommend avoiding travel to certain countries where there are a lot of cases of COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone in your home has COVID-19, there are additional things you can do to protect yourself:• Keep the sick person away from others – The sick person should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom if possible.\n",
      "• Use face masks – The sick person should wear a face mask when they are in the same room as other people. If you are caring for the sick person,you can also protect yourself by wearing a face mask when you are in the room. This is especially important if the sick person cannot wear a mask.\n",
      "• Be extra careful around body fluids – If you will be in contact with the sick person's blood, mucus, or other body fluids, wear adisposable face mask, gown, and gloves. If any bodily fluids touch your skin, wash your hands with soap right away.\n",
      "• Clean often – It's especially important to clean things that are touched a lot. This includes counters, bedside tables, doorknobs, computers, phones, tablets,and bathroom surfaces. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.\n",
      "• Wash hands – Wash your hands with soap and water often (as specified above)\n",
      "• You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding withother people or pets in your home. There is not yet a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.\n",
      "How can I prepare for a possible outbreak?\n",
      "It is hard to predict where future outbreaks might happen. The best thing you can do to stay healthy is to wash your hands regularly, avoid close contactwith people who are sick, and stay home if you are sick.\n",
      "If there is an outbreak in your area, schools or businesses might close temporarily. If this happens, or if someone in your family gets sick with COVID-19, you might need to stay at home for a period of time.There are things you can do to prepare for this. For example, you might be able to ask your employer if you can work from home, or take time off, if it becomes necessary. You can also make sure you have a way to get in touch with relatives, neighbors, and others in your area.This way you will be able to receive and share information easily.\n",
      "If you or others in your family are anxious about COVID-19, keep in mind that most people do not get severely ill or die from it. While it helps to be prepared, and there are things you can do to lower your risk.Where can I learn more?\n",

      "  Under the \"How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?\" Section?  You do realise that it takes at least 2-3 weeks for any measures to make a difference right?  Ok, another twitter expert it seems. Have a word with the CMO, he’ll probably be well pleased with your input  Aren't you the Twitter expert? You clearly think that you know better than the science supporting the action of governments globally?  No. I observed that the measures Italy have put in place havent seemed to have made a difference. I haven’t made any statements about how long measures take. You have.  Ok well you should probably read this  then you may learn why they are having such issues in Italy.  That’s virtually the same advice on the Gov website. It’s just a Q&amp;A. It doesn’t explain “why Italy are having issues”  As I said incubation period is 1-14 days. Italy has been locked down since the 9th march (13 days) there will be cases coming in since before that. People won't be in hospital from day 1 of symptoms. Time Delay is the killer here. By the time it's visibly bad it will be too late.  Ah ok. And where can I find all that information on the link you gave me?  Right OK, so if the measures in Italy are successful then the death rate should be falling drastically over the next 2 days?  Hopefully... Although you would also need to know how long people are showing symptoms before they die. Point is we can't wait and need to try everything we can to stop the spread. Otherwise the NHS will be on its knees. Italy has more hospital beds per capita than us.\n",

      "Brain teaser: Assume that 5% of the population has  antibodies, and the serology test has a 95% accuracy (specificity=sensitivity=0.95). What is the probability p that I have antibodies if I test positive? (For bonus points explain your answer in comments) Not needed to respond the teaser.  hence the answer is the \"tricky\" d) (which I did not get, because I wasn't watching for strict inequalities and thought I was picking \"greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95\") 0.5 if you are a frequentist. If you are an hypochondriac Bayesian and you work in an hospital with COVID-19 patients, i.e., p(antibodies) &gt; 0.05, then the probability shifts towards 1. If you apply Bayes you get the same result. Of course, things change if you change the prior, but that is unrelated to frequentist vs. bayesian. Hint: Thomas Bayes would be of great help Strict inequalities. Prior and likelihood neutralize each other exactly P(covid=Y)=0.05 P(test=Y)=0.095 P(test=Y|covid=Y)=0.95 P(Covid=Y|test=Y)= P(test=Y|covid=Y) P(covid=Y) / P(test=Y) ; 0.95 0.05 / 0.095 = 0.5 I'm taking my chance and not reading the other replies beforehand. It's 50/50!  We have two random binary variables: TST (good test) and ATB (antibodies present). Plus one observable: RES(ult). Given same specificity and sensitivity, we can assume both vars are independent (?) Thus, among four possible combinations of TST x ATB, we have two that lead to RES=positive, i.e., (TST and ATB) or (not TST and not ATB). P(TST,ATB)=P(not TST,not ATB)=0.0475. So, 50/50 between these two possibilities. 50%  400 person trial. 20 are positive. 380 negative. 361/380 of the negative test negative. 19/20 of the positive test positive.  But 19/380 negative test positive. Any positive test is 50/50 a true positive or false negative. If I test positive I am either a FP or a TP. The number of FPs is the number of negatives (95% of pop.) x the chance of misclassifying them (5%). The number of TPs is the number of positives (5% of the pop.) x the chance of correctly classifying them (95%). Hence, p=0.5. Cheeky answer categories! I'm always entertained by how similar Bayes' theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other. 50%  One of my first go-to questions while interviewing data science candidates True positives (TP): .95*5%\n",
      "False positives (FP): .05*95% =  TP\n",
      "p = TP/(TP+FP) = 50% But, here is the issue. I can say I have a magical prediction power. Simply, I predict a negative result for everybody. And I win over the lab test.... but I have zero sensitivity! None of the above. It is 50% =50%. Could use Bayes, but ppl don't understand that so do example:   Suppose 10k ppl tested.  at 5% incidence 500 have antibodies, 9500 don't.  .95*500 = 475 true positives.  0.05*9500 = 475 false negatives.  FN = TP so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0.5\n",

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.What is COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.Symptoms \n",
      "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if theyeyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”\n",

Couldn’t make this up  Don’t need a phd to know what herd immunity means.   It’s not a new concept. Boris Johnson said very early the plan was to “let it wash through the population”.

In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.What are the symptoms of COVID-19?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1/3Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. \n",
      "\n",
      "2/3Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.\n",

      "3/3How does COVID-19 spread?\n",
      "\n",
      "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. \n",
      "\n",
      "1/3These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "2/3People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "3/3Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?\n",
      "\n",
      "The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. \n",
      "\n",
      "1/2However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  \n",

HONESTLY I am wondering the same thing??? and like it is stressing me out that all these places are closing FOR WHAT it’s blown wayyyy out of proportion, I get trying to protect those who aren’t able to fight off a virus like it but the rest of us will be fine it’s so ridiculous I 100% get that!! but when you think about the flu or other viruses that are close or just as likely of killing someone with a suppressed immune system why weren’t we freaking out about that? Idk it just seems so blown out of proportion :/ To attempt to keep it from becoming like it is in Italy rignt now. Hospitals are overwhelmed there. Even though only 20% of the cases are hospitalized it’s still like 20 admissions per day. They had 300 cases just a week ago. It’s not super deadly but super contagious I think instead of closing they should just let people who are not healthy, old, immunocompromised, etc, leave and stay home from things without consequences. It seems much easier to do that than close everything for everyone It is being blown out of proportion. I think because there is no approved vaccine yet and it is seeming to spread pretty rapidly so it’s easier for panic to ensue.\n",

This suggests very strongly that immunity is being conferred. Mmm - feels like he is betting the farm on the fact there will be no second wave. If he's wrong, it's absolutely horrible. Well, the pattern of each local epidemic since the first 2 in China, on to South Korea, Iran and Italy have all been very similar. I think it’s very safe to assume that a population which has had that level of exposure of a London or New York won’t have a “second wave” Nothing. Did you listen to the whole interview? The slightly unpalatable truth is that there is a minimum level of infection and death needed to confer immunity in a population. He quantifies it as 4 weeks of “excess deaths” Here he was on March 30 telling us New York had turned the corner. \n",

Cmq è ulteriormente complesso perchè nn è banale nemmeno dire che il consensus sia \"la vera scienza\".  La domanda secondo me è assolutamente legittima. Non è che è posta male, ma indica davvero il dubbio che attanaglia molti. \"A chi devo fare riferimento?\", \"di chi mi devo fidare\", sono domande che si vedono molto spesso.  La comunità scientifica racchiude le conoscenze che abbiamo verificato e nella maggioranza dei casi è ciò che va' preso per riferimento, non bisogna riporre troppa fiducia nelle varie personalità. A prescindere dalla loro autorevolezza.  ma nn sono quelli i temi su cui si chiede fiducia. Burioni nn fa un claim scientifico da 2 mesi. \"state a casa\" nn è un claim scientifico. E' una opzione di policy con dei pro e dei contro che tra le tante cose ha un effetto sui tassi di contagio se eseguita. Non è scienza /  scienza è dire \"se state a casa probabilmente il tasso di contagio si riduce\". Il \"quindi state a casa a qualunque costo\" non è scienza.  No. L'OMS ha detto che stare a casa è il miglior modo per ridurre i contagi. Non probabilmente. Lo hanno affermato con certezza. Ed è confermato dai numeri. \n",
      "Non lo dice Burioni, né nessun altro. Lo dice l'organizzazione mondiale della sanità.  cmq no, è scientificamente provabile che il modo per garantire azzeramento dei contagi + che in ogni alternativa è uccidere tutti gli esseri umani. Se li uccidi tutti non hai + contagi tra umani. Partendo da lì, possiamo capire come il dire cosa \"minimizza\" nn serve mai a nulla.  Quindi secondo te l'OMS dovrebbe consigliare di fare una strage? A che pro, se il virus gira da settembre nel mondo e chissà quanta gente è contagiata?  Se vai sul loro sito sta scritto chiaramente che il modo migliore per prevenire il contagio è l'isolamento sociale, se tu poi ritieni che sia un altro il modo migliore stai dando la tua opinione.  definisci \"migliore\". Nn trovo su loro sito lista di tutte le possibili misure di contenimento con la stima della riduzione di r0 per ciascuna, e invece quello dovrebbero fare. Poi politica sceglie con loro ZITTI MENTRE SI SCEGLIE.  La politica anche è responsabile della \"intromissione\" degli scienziati, eh. Se tu prendi una decisione e scarichi la colpa sul parere del tecnico, te ne stai lavando le mani.  ancora, nn cogli cosa intendo. Loro devono dire \"chiusura fabbrica impatta X su tassi di contagio\". Poi paese fa i suoi conti e decide se preferisce tenerle aperte o no, dato che ogni chiusura ha dei costi, economici e sociali, dall'analisi dei quali i medici devono stare fuori.\n",

      "Herd immunity (or community immunity) occurs when a high percentage of the community is immune to a disease (through vaccination and/or prior illness), making the spread of this disease from person to person unlikely.Will you keep wearing masks and limiting your trips out until there is a vaccine widely available? Yep. Viruses don't disappear. Just look at measles. Controlled, literally no cases in western world until anti-vaxers. Measles are making a come back. Virus didn't disappear, just waited for stupid people to not vaccinate.  If vaccines work for the vaccinated, why does it matter if others choose to not vaccinate? If you're vaccines do not work then why bother with them at all?   Seriously?  No medical knowledge at all, eh?  What about those who can’t get vaccinated?  What about those who choose not to?  We eradicated diseases until people got complacent.   Plenty of medical knowledge here. I have reversed more medical conditions than most because I choose to be healthy. I make healthy choices. If you do not want to succumb to viruses help those who are sick get healthy. Contrary to popular belief it can be done.    Do some research in 2017 59 million people died worldwide. If you are conceived it is only natural that you will eventually die. No one is guaranteed one minute five years 30 years or a hundred years. That is life. The strong will survive. So be strong.\n",

Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.

The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. [2/3] These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  [3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. . Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?\n",

      "What am I trying to say? Everybody has their lane. That a particular trade is booming for someone you know does not mean it will boom for you. You do not know what they know. Forget the glamorous results you see, people's secret efforts settles most of these things outwardly.Many times you see many people post their achievements and accolades on social media and you say to yourself 'why not me?' When will it be my own turn? Do they have two heads? etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "No! Nothing is wrong with you. Just discover your own lane and press forward. YOU ARE YOU!!!Most people will not even write about their failures. I AM SUPER PROUD OF MY FAILURES. I failed forward. My failures gave me more lessons and earned me the right and boldness to teach other people about business.Your failures are a plus. You learn never to do things that same way. Reason I embraced the lean approach. I learnt how to start a business with a very little cost, validate and then grow it.  () is a clear example. I will tell the story some dayBy God's Grace (ALL GLORY TO GOD), doing my entrepreneurship career has gotten me recognition home and abroad including from President Obama through his Foundation, the Dutch Government, The Wharton School, Ventures Platform, Embassy of Ireland in Nigeria...Others are Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM) - a network of 121 Vice Chancellors of African Universities, Federal Government of Nigeria, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)...Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Embassy of France in Nigeria, Bank of Industry, African Entrepreneurship Awards, Morocco, and several others.Because of my work as an entrepreneur, I have had FREE, and I mean COMPLETELY FREE trips to some countries in Africa and Europe. It looks like I am bragging but I am actually not.There were times I applied for these things - put myself forward, pushed and pushed and I always got a NO! For me to share one award, recognition or free travel that came my way, I may have gotten NOs in a multiple of 10, if not 20.There is a particular annual fellowship I have applied for every year from inception back to back for 6 times in 6 years. I will try again the 7th time this year and look forward to being selected. That is how it is.You have to develop a thick skin to getting NOs, see them as part of the process and forge ahead. You have to learn from your mistakes and pick up yourself quickly. You have to ultimately look for your own lane and run your race.Do not let anyone guilt trip you in believing that this life is a competition. We are not wired to do the same things. \n",

      "I tried applying for jobs during this period and never did I get one. See, I have a very great CV, good schools, excellent grades and awesome work experience.As at that time, I had worked for an Impact Accelerator and Consulting firm in Nairobi, did a three year stint in two large commercial banks with several volunteering experiences.The first test invite I got, I passed and was asked to stay back for an interview same day. I was equally successful and was called to see the CEO which was the last stage of the recruitment process. Maybe my price scared them, I was not called back as promised.The second one I ever got much later, I argued with my interviewer who felt he knew everything. LOL. \n",

      "I didn't get both jobs. Thank God. I am sure God was looking at me and shaking his head like \"see this boy I gave a master-plan trying to run the race of someone else\".Discover your own lane and that is where you will shine effortlessly. This does not in anyway downplay the part of hard work. You will work extra hard and even harder as you go up. Succeeding is easy. Staying successful is not.That does not mean you will not celebrate your wins. Celebrate them. Enjoy them. But you know what, move on quickly and do the same things you were doing even more.I HAVE MY STORY! YOU HAVE YOURS! \n",

      "They are never the same even though our results might be similar. It could even bring us plenty money and fame. But it is never the same.Finally, success is not even about the money and the fame alone. It is about living your life in a way that you feel happy and fulfilled. Only that, money makes the happiness and fulfillment sweeter. \n",

Surely there is something that Congress can do about it! At least try! Spread the word loud and often!!

(which was The Great Depression/Recession, and previous other crashes), but from a virus... If Capitalism cannot prepare for a pandemic, why do we need it? In a race to DESTROY America... greatest irony ever. Tell that to the people that are “protesting”. Trick question, as my life IS my life. Because Capitalism doesn’t, hadn’t, won’t, and NEVER, will provide “freedom.” (Just ask any homeless, imprisoned, broken down, disconnected from reality, or immigrant about “freedom”, and you’ll notice how they talk about it.) To WHAT state? And being a slave to whom? If you thought using historical materialism, you’ll realize that we exported all of our problems decades ago. If anyone is going to complain about hearing others say: “Death to America” or the sight of the American flag being burned- - perhaps you may want to RETHINK why it is they hate America so much. It’s a Herculean task for you to question your patriotism, but it’s Sisyphian if you think WE will solve “our” “problems”, by simply ignoring or demonizing the solutions at hand. I hate to keep saying it, but Capitalism will implode - with or without - a virus. Theirs is a crisis of abundance. (Not of shortage.) If Capitalism cannot solve its problems, then why do WE need it? Don’t worry, it’ll try to “solve” it’s problems - BY FORCE - if need be... If you don’t believe me, all you have to do is look up these changes for yourself, then week for humanity. But by then, your mind will already be made up, and you’ll be complicit, regardless of the consequences. After all, YOU got to protect your Stock Market Gods... so if you wish to SAVE the economy, go on ahead. No one is stopping you. Bartering. You’re trading goods for services. But under Capitalism, you don’t own your labor power. And if you wish to know how it relates to political ideology, consider reading “Manufacturing Consent.” Or, if you’re feeling adventurous, “Blackshirts and Reds.” Now, what exactly, do those with power, want to retain?

That's 229,767,666 people in the U.S. alone.  reached this threshold by figuring out how infectious COVID-19 is specifically. This is called R0 value. It measures how many people an infected person is likely to infect. This is how COVID-19's R0 values compare to other diseases.  though the numbers are high and it may seem simple at first glance, most scientists aren't onboard with relying on . Why? This tactic would take between 1 million - 2 million deaths in the U.S. and 30 million around the world. That's millions too many.  a vaccine can provide widespread immunity, communities need to prioritize keeping case numbers low and manageable, especially heading into the fall, when more activities will have to move indoors and the flu season will add more strain.

See this January 15 info of WHO         They can only go on the data that's available at the time. \"No clear evidence\" of something doesn't mean it's definitely not happening, just that they don't have scientific proof of it. The science changes as we gather more data - that's to be expected       It would be helpful if . didn't use double-negatives to get out important messages / notices. Thanks.       Kind of a double negative here in your 1st post. Are you saying IT IS OK TO USE IBUPROFEN?  The 2nd post makes it seem like you’re consulting Physicians.       I love ibuprofen. no one should ruin its' reputation :')        It complicates the illness       How many double negatives can you have to make this more unclear to lessen understanding?

      "\n",
      "Many governments seem to taken for granted that is is harmful though, maybe is there no general agreement on this       Why do you use ibuprofen when it's not an antivirus.       human pathogenic coronaviruses bind target cells together using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can be increased by treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers. Aka IBUPROFEN       Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19,” Lei Fang, MD, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in the department of biomedicine at University Hospital Basel, Switzerland       Because this question has come up: For people with heart disease (prior heart attack, stroke, heart bypass or coronary stents) who are taking baby Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA 81 mg), please don't stop taking it because of COVID-19 fears 1/2       2/2 there is no evidence whatsoever that baby Aspirin puts you at risk with COVID-19.       Despite the double negative, if you read the entire statement the gist of the  recommendation  can be understood.  It is OK  to use Ibuprofen if no other contra-Indications exist. Based on available information, this seems to be very reasonable.        \"Based on currently available information..\" is unhelpful. It's a very broad okay for a very specific question.          It looks like a lab strain someone is trying to patent to have a science vendor sell. Its an “attenuated” virus, meaning it’s a weakened form not able to cause infection. We need these types of things to make studying the virus easier in a lab setting.       Thanks for the clarity, Ibuprofen is a commonly used drug so this helps        But for me, my VA primary does say to avoid ibuprofen &amp; naproxen sodium.\n",

Thanks for letting us know that’s it’s not not ok       We will use Tylenol for now and not Advil / Ibuprofen just in case!       Our local media was saying different thing.       WHO wants a future where only English majors have survived.       Clunky wording with an unfortunate typo thrown in too. These messages need to be clear and understood.

But this is a new virus that needs to be slowed down for our medical field to catch up.Tower thread - The fact people are going out to crowded public areas (bars for the most part) is mind boggling. Yes younger people (under 55/60) are mildly effected for the most part (unless you have a preexisting illness). But any age is still just as contagious as the next.You can have COVID-19 and not show a single symptom. Then go visit your grandparent/parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint. So many people are so uneducated on COVID-19. Yes the media has completely overblown this.The only way to allow the medical field to catch up is SOCIAL DISTANCE yourself. If you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly (e.i. China &amp; Italy) causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with COVID-19 that may or may not be ina critical condition. On top of that that, it’s the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up, then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out. It’s not a beat it, it’s a slow it down.As young people in society it’s our duty to slow this virus down. Avoid social gatherings, avoid large crowds, wash your fucking hands, wipe down machines at the gym, socially distance yourself. If you have mindset of “I’m young, and this really doesn’t effect me”, then not onlyare you being selfish but you’re the route cause for spreading. In 2 weeks, the people out in public crowds now are going to be the same people complaining when all nonessential companies (medical, emergency, food sources) are closed for 3 weeks to try and control all this.\n",

No one has yet to be able to answer that but I assume they are still testing to determine? Who knows?  My bro works for a biotech company who makes Covid tests and because covid mutates so slowly (unlike influenza) there should be lasting immunity. Which also means if enough people get it, it will fade away completely. Just like SARS and MERS (both coronaviruses)  Are you new to this?  That’s a pretty common sun-tues rate of change. Because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunity's work. Harris County's mask edict has just been extended until late August.

Yeah, be a REAL shame if herd immunity was achieved naturally before a vaccine can be rushed to market.  NIH has been performing one. Results will be out in the next month or Two.  112 n no a v Because reliable tests aren’t out there Alex, be careful with antibody tests. Body deals usually so easy with the Sars COV 2, that most of people don't even develop antibodies.  Is that when the often mentioned T- cells come into the picture?  I'm not sure what you mean but maybe I get some of it? I believe that there are no coincidences ever. So how is it that ALL THE EVENTS HAPPENING ARE RIGHT ON TIME? FOR SOMETHING. HOW CAN THE VIRUS DO WHAT IT'S DOING VERY METHODICALLY AND SPECIFICALLY AT CERTAIN TIMES AND PLACES Alex, what's happening in NC?  I live here and all I hear is gloom and doom.  Despite the numbers our own illustrious  dashboard tells us.  Great article!  New York City antibody results were over 20% two months ago. I would expect that they are much higher now, but there has been silence on that issue. Assuming 20% positive on NYC antibody test, that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from NYC alone. My guess is the real antibody results in NYC are much higher, which is good news, not bad news, of course, because it leads to herd immunity. It's even more fundamental. \"Novo\" Wuhan virus found in waste water samples in Spain - in early 2019. The whole Fauci narrative was BS from Day One.  The deaths are seasonal, predictable and many are the result of malpractice  It’s irrelevant because by Fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero. They won’t be able to hide that glaring fact. I suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming, since it endangers the narrative. The CDC says for every 1 case we identified, there were at least 10 we didn’t.  Fauci claimed yesterday the US would see 100,000 cases per day. Do the math.  We have been well over his number for some time.  We are now identifying those by testing people who aren’t ill. And two months ago they said that’s what needed to happen, more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms.  Now they are saying that’s bad bad because, well that’s a lot of cases.  I feel like we are being punked. Nefarious? They want this to continue? Or incompetence?  Pharmaceutical industrial complex  has FDA EUA approved Covid- 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities! This will help identify those with antibodies! Antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around. Talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry, molecular, or microbiology field, they will tell you the same thing. \n",
      "\"New research from Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 demonstrate so-called T-cell-mediated immunity to the new coronavirus, even if they have not tested positively for antibodies.\" Probably because they're saying the tests are inaccurate.   What are you referring to in NC? Fredericksburg VA this morning my husband was talked out of antibody test by doctor because she said they’re inconclusive and pointless. my wife and I did our part to reduce the death rate by surviving COVID.  It wasn't fun but almost everyone who get it survives--including almost every person in the U.S. workforce.  have politicized COVID because restarting the economy helps Trump. Likely adding the number of “positive  antibodies” test results in with the “covid positive” results.  It’s easier to fluff the numbers that way  cause it is “all covid” ...

Hopefully that data will be aggregated and released. Also, I look forward to seeing this one on  in two weeks  Well you live in NY - enjoy. While good news, think we’ve a longer way to go to get to herd immunity. Alex, what’s happening in N.C. haven’t seen any stats. Their website is not much help.

Not abolishing the virus as herd would, but it’s ability to spread is extremely limited in NY. Angry twitter man has found all the answers  Arithmetic has good reason to be angry with us all these days. And T-Cell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies.  New York, Italy, etc seems to show that we're nearing herd immunity, like it or not.  Not sure about doing things NY or Italian style. They basically euthanized the vulnerable by using nursing homes for CV19 patients. Mental midgets.  Hundo p I thought NIH was doing this? I volunteered but apparently was not selected.. madness, we are in the hands of luddites,  cretins &amp;  I think you are gonna be right.  Or close.  But the evidence will be, I think, on Worldometer or similar.  Deaths for sure are WAY down.  Let's see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon.  I hope so.

Or do the T cells (if present) automatically override/ cancel out the ABs? Did you see this study from Karolina ka in Sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people don’t produce antibodies but produce an effective T cell immune response?     Remember when Birx said on April 1, 2020,”there is no more flu”. After that day any flu deaths were counted as Covid. We stupidly went along and believed anything they said. Meanwhile Arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care. Resources are being rationed and people are dying that could have been saved. Might wanna do a bit more research on antibody testing You will never get that data. The last thing Democrats want is the true on this hoax to get out.

Im sorry but dish towels and bandanas dont stop viruses!!!        Not sure about dish towels, but there’s plenty of new data showing how face coverings are very effective at SLOWING the spread. Nothing will stop this virus, but if we can slow it down, that’s what we should do!         Then let’s open everything up Mike. If these masks work, why not open up 100%. You always say we gotta be just as aggressive in opening up as we were in shutting down. I’ll wear the mask but let’s open up AZ!         We would love for everything to be open, so we can all go to a Cardinals game or go out to lunch! But again, masks won’t STOP the virus, just SLOW it. People still need to be vigilant and wear masks and social distance from others.          There may not be any herd immunity. Folks who have had it and recovered are getting it again. There may never be a vaccine if folks are susceptible to it more than once\n",

      "   People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.   Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

I do not think a President in the past was able to attend every memorial service. Have we forgetten the one he DID attend.

Every word that you speak further confirms you as a petty, narrow-minded, partisan moron.  have you attended the funeral of every employee thats died while working for you? atravesty why? It won't bring him back or make it any easier?

What about the oil CEO's who's interests we are there for in the first place? why is this different than any other soldier kiled in combat? Did you go?

Besides, if he HAD attended, people would just complain that he was ignoring his other duties right? Fuck Obama! Every man has his faults.

If it’s taking a break why can’t we book summer holidays?

BUT seasonality and low R from lockdown synergise.        no, seasonality is about lowering average R due to factors that will include behaviour (less cramming together indoors), susceptibility (cold nose), viable virus longevity in environment etc.  not about antibodies (for common cold, v. short-lived immunity may also play part).        The way I think about it, individual immunity isn’t the only factor in determining the herd immunity threshold - susceptibility (including behaviour) is equally important or more so.

They probably have other things to worry about like keeping the shows running and the staff and procedures safe and don't need the extra work  Genuine question, not being a cow, how hard would it be to film two characters already doing a scene in the pub to slip on/off a jacket and complain about empty shelves in the Kabin/Minute Mart/ Price Slice?  Soaps based on real life and the corona virus is part of lives now.. They don't have to have stats, maybe humour like singing happy birthday while washing hands before serving customers at the cafe .. Just reinforce what government has said   For many it's not really funny though is it? So I don't think EE taking the mick with hand sanitiser would cheer them up   Exactly. I'm already staying/working from home due to the Coronavirus. One person in the town where I teach has contracted the virus. Now schools are shut down. I don't want to watch my favorite soaps talking about it.\n",

Where is the peer reviewed(!) evidence that it does? Iam sure 5G has its own health issues but there is no link between 5G and covid 19 I don’t know how true this is,but if it is,How then do we curb the spread if departments are telling people to go back to work?? 5G doesn't cause Covid-19 and those who say 5G causes radiation there's two type ionising and non-ionising the bad one is the ionising and the one that's \"good\" is the non-ionising of which frequencies are measured by means of Electromagnetic Spectrum.  Big scepticism towards any \"facts\" the media puts forward. With so many contradicting \"facts\" flowing around, best to accept the safest version, especially if these \"facts\" are not substantiated by trustworthy sources. If 5G is faster and it spreads this virus does this mean 4G and the rest was then slowly making us sick? Dont they all have to some extend emit radiation.

It’s called developing heard immunity. Hiding in your house from the virus like it’s a cat burglar does not work. I’m not saying not to wear your mask.  This is false. The vaccine will create immunity as they have for other communicable diseases. There is no need to risk people’s lives until the vaccine because you don’t like a mask.

In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS, SARS and now, COVID-19.Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.

Which most of the analysts, besides you, agree that he is a once in lifetime draft pick and a game changer. Right. That means the defense needs to be excellent for them to be correct. WHen the D is not excellent, I will be proven 100% correct. He is really good. The defense will not be. I of course disagree with you about the defense with Jack Del Rio as D-Coordinator,  as well as how the offense will perform. This isn't the Redskins of the past few years Danny! Recognize! I recognize that a new DC means so much more than 1 player on that side of the ball ever could.
