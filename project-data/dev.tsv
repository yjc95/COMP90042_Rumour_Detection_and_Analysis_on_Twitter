really amber alert website goes dark under government shutdown obama s just being an a hole trying to make it as uncomfortable for everybody as possible a volunteer amber alert is needed oh lord really amber alert website goes dark under government shutdown outrageous amberalert shut down only possible happy ending to this move would be if went missing go to website delete word unavailable in url hit enter site is fully functioning just not amber alerts it makes sense if you consider the manpower required to barricade as much open space as bureaucratic mandates deem possible everyone in the us call the wh immed to demand amber alert back in service another new low for the obama admin obama regime is committing these over the top outrages in order to evaluate patriot response identify opponents don t forget wh credo make it hurt this is terrible but maybe the congress should have done their job and have passed a bill to fund it just disgusting wow first osama now the system what else will kill before january 2017 does it cost more to run that website than obama s golfcourse or two chefs i doubt it omg how much is gov collecting 100 billion month that s the first thing they cut nothing in middle management its time for nobama to go wait the this is obama s shutdown idiocy is actually working on you knuckleheads let s see no protection for the abducted the unborn the elderly the producers no compromise gop hold the line dem s ready made it clear they don t care about the sick children so what makes you think they care about the missing ones gotta make it hurt as much as possible if a few kids disappear harry and the dems can really push the blame knife deep it does not get any lower than this the next 100 ppl to go to the capital blog will replace currently setting senators what happened to things having to do with public safety would not be impacted but if he can save one child amber alert program placed in jeopardy by house republicans vote predators don t attack kids when the government is shut down tsk tsk i would have thought you knew that harry reid s war on missing children if they dont care for children with cancer why worry about these kids based on the conversations in my area the selective shut downs are backfiring on the dems as the admitted liking it really amber alert website goes dark under government shutdown it s all about making the people suffer to exagerate big gov dependence what s really non essential is him and croneies isn t the amber foundation private obama has it in his head to blame the republicans just like he did bush america wake up govt sweat shops probably will become obama s end game to keep obamacare active during bankruptcy of usa human rights evils who needs the govt use twitter gt democrats are in so much trouble even bill clinton can not help them anymore bill claimed president needs four more years children amp seniors are the most vulnerable in any society the 0 administration are using them as leverage pitiful the man cuts off his nose to spite his face despicable if the national parks are closed shouldn t they have no personnel working at them will tornado warnings be next just the website is down not the service the alerts are posted on the state level twist things much its only fitting that the party of abortion at any cost is now deny access to parks and amber alert websites at all cost the regime is all about bringing maximum pain to the american people i am disgusted sincere question does taking down actually save any anybody know sick there are 2 kids missing from our nbrhd now how do they sleep keep kids home amp safe and the fish stopped swimming in the ocean they shut that down too this is an obamanation lol that s gonna save a lot of money that is going too far but michelle obama s get moving site is open for business well at least obama will get to play golf rt and this makes sense to you crossing the line report it respond like journalists obama specifically picks the most crucial that will impact people purposely to get political points for reaction don t worry though site is still running amber alert evicting elderly closing businesses on leased land vet monuments but bo has a full staff amp the gc is open tell congress to put a clean cr up for a vote then it s over are you ever going to correct your faux outrage 83 open is not a shutdown what a crock obama likely wishing for the worst to advance his anti american agenda so much for children in danger when will these guys pull their heads out they work for the people not vice versa amp flotus site didn t miss a beat rt really amber alert website goes dark under government shutdown why are u surprised it s called shutdown for a reason u moron tell ur gop goons to stop playing with peoples lives don t worry is still up now how do we catch them obama voters rt really amber alert website goes dark under government shutdown it cost more to block it than it would have to keep it running yes you moron you thought this was just pretend rt really amber alert website goes dark under government shutdown thank you you ve go to f n be kidding me first it s harry letthesickkidsdie reid now barrack letthekidsstaylost obama you re not serious but the military golf courses stay open probably but what do we expect certainly not have an overgrown government like this to handle things the right way canwe pretty sick isnt it how is that not essential thank your friends and you know you don t really care so if amber alerts get shutdown during govt shutdown amp ocare gets implemented would ocare shutdown in next gov shutdown that will qualify as a new low but also a wake up call of why govmtn should be restrained i wonder if the bot will get retroactive pay when the app is turned back on he should be on mt douchemore which is closed due the shutdown gee it s almost as if the government actually does stuff when it s operational i m sure the message capability that all cell phones have to have now allowing prez to send msg to all cells is still wkng how can this possible what is going on i m seriously getting nervous over the country what levels is willing to go it s unbelievable rt really amber alert website goes dark under government shutdown yes really michelle that is real low really is there anyone left that doesn t see this tyrant for what he is what if it was one of his children omg i am pissed we do not have a dictator tipping point or does a child have to actually die here s a link for ya can we say desperate and s a d and yet they van pay guys to guard concrete and marble monuments obama is showing us the power he has this is very scary and big gov people should beware and worried too not really just the doj website explaining how system works is down he disgusts me so i no he can t be impeached yet but at what point can he or cause the senate wont agree to we live with him till 2014 as a father how is this not priority number one am i living in america or somewhere else michelle you obviously hate government you need to get a hobby par for the course yet obama and family are still in residence on fed property with electricity tv computers etc elitist dem slobs wanna bet the silver alert still works he s tougher on us than real terrorists obama and all his liberal worshipers are a bad joke how low can this they go well heck we re from the government and we ve got our priorities eating your vegetables is important ,1

remember seasonal flu is very different to pandemic flu if someone says covid 19 is just like the flu check which one they re talking about if they mean seasonal flu take what they say with a bucketload of salt 1918 spanish flu one of the worst pandemics in history killed up to 50 million people 1957 asian flu killed at least a million 1968 hong kong flu killed at least a million 1977 russian flu less than a million deaths 2009 swine flu killed several hundred thousand one of those five pandemics the russian flu appears to have been just an old defrosted flu strain from a laboratory people alive in the 1950s were immune and the virus was weirdly similar to earlier ones so really we re down to four truly novel pandemics anyone reading this has almost certainly lived through a pandemic the h1n1 swine flu in 2009 but we were lucky there that it was extremely mild with a fatality rate not much different to seasonal flu fatality rates often fall as an epidemic spreads but it would be unwise to assume that case fatality in every pandemic will fall to swine flu levels all the evidence so far suggests covid 19 mortality is higher by at least an order of magnitude so don t panic but please don t be complacent lots of tech finance types are still talking about this as if it s no big deal virologists and epidemiologists are taking it far more seriously hoy did all those pandemic go away herd immunity gradually built up to the point it wasn t able to spread easily and under this selective pressure the virus evolved to different and less fatal strains as the name implies seasonal flu goes round the world every year we have high rates of immunity to it because many of us have been exposed before and we even have vaccines to prevent it pandemic flu happens just a few times in every century and is much more alarming d ,1

vatican says meeting w should not be considered a form of support her supporters had the contacts with papal hierarchy to get this set up those supporters keeping it in the news i ll believe that when meets with leaders of the community the sent a clear message by meeting with why are either of these idiots getting any coverage why the hell not it is perplexing read an article yesterday that said pope was unaware something to do with vatican politics not what she is claiming takes a lot of courage to continue being a bigot whilst your country is trying not to be kim davis makes my skin crawl ask potus why does chicago his home town has very strict gun laws amp very high gun violence 1 of the great things about this pope is he doesn t care about appearances maybe he was modeling peace amp forgiveness thank god well she s a very lucky person to have met him of course it s a form of support it just shouldn t have any impact on our political policies he supported the death row inmate too she got elected in local election when her mom retired from the position its a small town so go figure hope he gave her a wtf about being divorced 3 times many people meet with a pope apparently this was a blessing in dc he probably never heard of her then wham he s in a storm all of a sudden the memorable visit left a bad taste in my mouth too late what other reason would the pope have for a private meeting she s not even catholic the face of mental illness being made famous saw your status on facebook the other day yes just like people do for imagrents then what should it be considered unless he performed an exorcism on that witch it will be considered support a church desperate to look cool is a sad thing she just needs to go away should have kept this meeting private bet that s what pope wanted shes using it to glorify publicize herself more the vatican is has given in smh has more guts and stronger in her faith than the vatican and it pope is a bullshitter what is it then does catholic church support homosexuality does it conduct gay marriages so what was it then trying to help the sinner stop homophobing a strategy session swapping culture war stories an affair don t tell me that the vatican us telling a lie it s definitely support but the pope is also someone who has done nothing to stop clergy abuse so who really cares then exactly how should the meeting be considered shouldn t have met with to begin with rewarded bad behavior nor forgiveness so what is it with god there is no sitting on the wall with that meeting the pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was buy this album if you love the pope terrible to follow catholic doctrine by a pope seriously who ya gonna believe me or the pope they lyin most assuredly not ms davis has a true commitment to god and his word the pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and too late for this i stand with you kim god be with you did he spank her so if all the military and police who protected him on his us visit refused to do their job based on religious beliefs is that ok you support or you don t sorry too many on the fence it broke with how many of god s gay children did meet in secret or public whether supportive or not the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind find a solution to oregon like issues important point is that he met with her and not gay groups gives quiet support for faithful defending traditional marriage so i assume the catholic religion supports same sex marriage millions of catholics wait a lifetime to share a moment with a pope why her because the pope is a socialist who knows propaganda maybe not but the pope has a recent history of rejecting an openly gay ambassador from france to the vatican says much popeturd is back tracking already the pc police flexing their muscle again disgusting and people still worship this false idol why would he meet with her anyway you lost me off my list simply stop talking about her funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be he met with a gay couple the day before kim davis then he shouldn t have met with her doesn t matter why or what was said she will put her own spin on it to further her homophobia just like they do with abortion issue no it should not the vatican is hedging its bets in case she goes full psycho she s halfway there pope met w her in support of her religious liberty amp conscience to put god s law above constitution which he made clear his position he too will stand before god but won t be left standing repent of thy ways amp turn to god amp his ways be encouraged that is a lie and the vatican didn t say that homosexual media lies like homosexuals and lesbians pope francis may have spoke against jesus christ but he is not stupid enough to take a stand on nonsense by the kentucky clerk then how should we consider it a show of 1 kim davies is1 of d most courageous human i know alone she stood publically to defend god s guide for mankind s progress amp evolution that s right people somebody needs to tell this lady to stop judging that s a sin read the rest of the sentence not support for all of what she is doing they qualified it meaning they support some of it he is a holy man giving comfort i bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do i really have to talk to her but what i heard on news it seems it was a form of support it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b s exactly she should follow the patriots mantra do your job well thank god she met the pop though it s sad the vatican knows what the bible says n still don t provide support for kim sad sad ,0

can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at d early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill who is assessing ongoing research how likely am i to catch the covid 19 the risk depends on where you are and more whether there is a covid 19 outbreak unfolding there for most people in most locations the risk of catching covid 19 is still low however there are now places around the world cities or areas where the disease is spreading covid 19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped as has been shown in china and some other countries unfortunately new outbreaks can emerge rapidly it s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go there is daily updates on the situation ,0

the world health organization insists the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes the who reports this would make grocery shopping a pretty serious issue we ve been told that social distancing is what was needed if these studies are true then we d need much more isolation for what it s worth i certainly hope that this airborne transmission is disproven fingers crossed it would also make the use of masks mandatory for everyone btw which is something the cdc has been very reluctant to propose the question i have is why covid 19 is less transmissible than measles if it is actually an airborne transmitted disease the size of respiratory particles for is thought to be larger than for measles so it was thought to spread less readily this latest research suggests that these prior assumptions are not correct and that can spread much more easily than previous guidance i thought that article was pretty clear but here s another one just in case i ll also clearly say there is no evidence that mosquitos can spread the coronavirus in the same light that there s no evidence my penis can shoot laser beams ,0

the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol based hand rub or washing them with soap and water to protect yourself clean your hands frequently with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water also avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus no hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 ncov to protect yourself against the new coronavirus you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water once your hands are cleaned you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever i e have a higher than normal body temperature because of infection with the new coronavirus however they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus no spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes i e eyes mouth be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus no vaccines against pneumonia such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b hib vaccine do not provide protection against the new coronavirus the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 ncov and who is supporting their efforts although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 ncov vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus no there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold however regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties however there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus does the new coronavirus affect older people or are younger people also susceptible people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus 2019 ncov older people and people with pre existing medical conditions such as asthma diabetes heart disease appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus no antibiotics do not work against viruses only bacteria the new coronavirus 2019 ncov is a virus and therefore antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment however if you are hospitalized for the 2019 ncov you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co infection is possible are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus to date there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus 2019 ncov however those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners pls don t panic people with fake news because it s not real all facts are in these threads ,0

we know they re shallow we know they are frivolous the first description of the rich mom is that she s simple it s part of the hook part of the reason why everything happens so why do we need it reiterated with this played out stereotype it just doesn t quite fit i hesitate to say there s such a thing as a perfect film but having just watched parasite for the first time it hits pretty damn fucking close i m genuinely trying to think of things that bugged me the one that struck me the most was how yet again we have a thriller type film like us where we have to include native americans somehow it s beyond played out at this point amp i wish they d gone with something else bong joon ho clearly trusts his audience having just seen train to busan last year his development from even then to now is clear he doesn t bother with excess and parasite is so well trimmed but here we have just a little fat a chewy piece on an otherwise perfect steak and what would ve made the film even closer to perfect was if some people who saw it weren t alienated by his inclusion of that trope i remember the discourse stuff like that hurts folk i remember it with us too and that s really the only thing bad about parasite it rightfully joins the ranks of annihilation mad max fury road no country for old men pacific rim pan s labyrinth there will be blood and us as films riley will keep thinking about for years it s deserving they all are almost perfect and i really will keep thinking i ve wanted to see that one but i hear it has ghosts i think that s part of the intent but also it s to show how western values have been forced into korean society the rich family identifies with americans and blindly reproduces the harm the us has caused should be clear i don t think that excuses it you re right that it s a tired and harmful depiction but i think even if it could have been handled a lot better it was going for something deeper than just reinforcing how they re out of touch they are obsessed with american culture and the way that comes out is the son obsessed with cowboys and indians from our westerns they don t consider the cultural implications at all bc they re so far removed from it geographically and economically ,0

attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot that s because brown didn t stop and he kept charging idiots are going to be like omg he stood over him and executed him ugh lt lt pathetic so he asked to remain anonymous and was speaking to a friend on a video chat service if their is a pause on the sequences of shots is premeditated now the police stop and continue shooting instead of reporting a story you re creating one unrespected so called news i understand your intolerance for idiots but what gives you the impression that your version is absolutely correct so after 6 7 shots we re to believe that mike isn t incapacitated but charges wilson at pause amp that s when he had to kill him b s attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot must mean it was a struggle nah olha isso pessoal sacuda a cabeça e descobra quem é essa pessoa veja a foto em what new audio uh oh now we gots to go loot some shit amp burn down our own neighborhood again cuz we needs jobs that is murder can you without a doubt that those are the gunshots cmon cnn pause after 6th 0 single shot first just opened up on him how much more til brown family gets justice its murder wilson liar y all will think th worst of it all cause it don t amp won t go your way for all of the idiots thinking wilson was in the right remember this mike brown was unarmed with his hands in the air attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot maybe you assholes should wait to see if this is even accurate before you stir up more shit for innocent people in ferguson reload wilson will soon have a pink jumpsuit no gun in prison and a cop too lord have mercy he said no sorry attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot don lemon needs to give it a break and get back to real news this is getting old murder attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot always some wild shit weeks later the witness never mentioned a pause during the shooting until after the audio surfaced i guess mr joe klein can excuse this as a metaphor aggression now we have a channel dedicated to michael brown it s called cnn attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot but let s not blame cops gtfo if he would have different race nobody even talk about it that racist prick deserves to go to jail simple as that unreal dude was spittin mad game attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot oh my rt attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot so what would back up that may have rushed him he tried non lethal gunshots then had to stop the threat image of the source exactly in that pause lies the question black or white nid 2 face another 11 so dat it can respect da existance an da rytz ov others here is story black cop kills white man he was 2 ys older than the gentle giant media hide race aug 20 attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot when brown was falling attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot people believe this if wilson had already shot him repeatedly by the time mb rushed him wouldnt the rush be self defence where did this tape come from this sounds like a shooting in a war battle you can stop a person with 1 or 2 shots people are made the same no one is made of steel friend of wilson said brown mocked the officer and charged shld be radio station caller who claimed to be friend of wilson s thx question is if tape is authentic why wait this long to come forward probably his tv in the background smells fishy yeah from the shot in the car and then in the street how much brains does that take to understand let the grand jury decided does anyone know how many rounds the gun could hold if he was running away from the cop car why would he turned around to charge the the cop doesn t make sense thank god that the fbi is involved in this investigation so that nothing is swept under the rug cnn the worst liberal news outlet out there cause that sounded so authentic lmfao why didn t he come out right away i bet if the victim was a different race we wouldn t be talking about this attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot hmm well duh always a pause when i am shooting competition handgun maybe he intentionally missed in order to get him to attempt to stop without force 6 shots pause 4 shots attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot witnesses have always described that catch up it means the officer stopped shooting then started again what if it was a jam need more data around this entire situation attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot cold blooded murder it s taking all this time for these witnesses to come forward how do we even know it was from the brown shooting attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot best to have it analyzed and verified before playing it and instead of giving it to police some atty gives it to cnn attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot won t mean a thing rt attorney new audio reveals pause in gunfire when michael brown was shot does not sound realistic at all plus appears to be lifted and read directly from a facebook post we need info on the caller for continued reporting sharp left so fly you are awesome you did it i have added your tweet to my 18yr old boy shot by police unarmed in ottawa canada sat has anyone even mentioned him no don t tell me this isn t a radical thing you re so pretty baby time to equip every officer with a camera good mornning if you v any questions about islam please vist live

can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms what are the symptoms of covid 19 the most common symptoms of covid 19 are fever tiredness and dry cough some patients may have aches and pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually some people become infected but don t develop any symptoms and don t feel unwell most people about 80 recover from the disease without needing special treatment around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid 19 by taking some simple precautions regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water why washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing why when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus if you are too close you can breathe in the droplets including the covid 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease avoid touching eyes nose and mouth why hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses once contaminated hands can transfer the virus to your eyes nose or mouth from there the virus can enter your body and can make you sick make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze then dispose of the used tissue immediately why droplets spread virus by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold flu and covid 19 stay home if you feel unwell if you have a fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical attention and call in advance follow the directions of your local health authority why national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections keep up to date on the latest covid 19 hotspots cities or local areas where covid 19 is spreading widely if possible avoid traveling to places especially if you are an older person or have diabetes heart or lung disease why you have a higher chance of catching covid 19 in one of these areas for more information please contact us e mail info com ,0

4 covid 19 is just like the flu sars cov 2 definitely has flu like symptoms aches fever and cough both covid 19 and flu can also lead to pneumonia however covid 19 is more dangerous with with a mortality rate between 1 and 3 10 50 times greater than the seasonal flu 2 older people gt 60 and young lt 14 are at risk sars cov 2 like other coronaviruses can infect people of any age however anyone with preexisting health conditions like cancer diabetes lung infections immunodeficiency is likely to get affected 5 everyone with covid 19 dies this statement is untrue as we have mentioned above covid 19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people in fact 80 face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization 6 cats and dogs spread coronavirus currently very little evidence however in hong kong a pomeranian whose owner had covid 19 became infected the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus 7 face masks protect against coronavirus disposable face masks may not provide protection yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly droplets can still enter the mouth and nose thus viral particles can also enter 8 hand dryers kill coronavirus hand dryers dont kill only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9 sars cov 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold all coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host which can be humans animals covid19 is thought to be passed from animals poultry to humans 9 2 thus some infect humans and many infect animals too the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans 10 antibiotics kill coronavirus antibiotics only kill bacteria and not viruses 14 thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons covid 19 symptoms only 2 10 days after infection and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with 15 flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid 19 as sars cov 2 is different than other viruses no existing vaccines protect against infection so please dont panic follow the govt rules of curfew isolation amp eat healthy finally dont forget to pray shambho mahadeva very nice thread insect ,1

drinking alcohol does not protect you against covid 19 and can be dangerous frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems and can in fact damage your immune system which helps fight against the virus covid 19 myths vs truth 5g doesn t spread covid 19 viruses cannot travel on radio waves mobile networks covid 19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5g mobile networks covid 19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs sneezes or speaks exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25c degrees does not prevent the coronavirus disease covid 19 you can catch covid 19 no matter how sunny or hot the weather is countries with hot weather have reported cases of covid 19 you can recover from the coronavirus disease covid 19 catching covid 19 does not mean you will have it for life most of the people who catch covid 19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies if you catch the disease make sure you treat your symptoms being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort does not mean you are free from the covid 19 or any other lung disease the most common symptoms of covid 19 are dry cough tiredness and fever take an official test to confirm covid 19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates from the evidence so far the covid 19 virus can be transmitted in all areas including areas with hot and humid weather regardless of climate adopt protective measures when leaving the house for essentials cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases the normal human body temperature remains around 36 5 c to 37 c regardless of the external temperature or weather taking a hot bath does not prevent the virus taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching covid 19 your body temperature is 36 5 c to 37 c regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful as it can burn you the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes the coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets ,0

in other words devs have the knowledge they need to make changes therefore why do we need it to make a fuss about it killers already send hateful messages including death threats even to survivors they suspect to be swf the community cant handle that info in short i was asked today to do this so i ll just make a poll would you guys like a ui added for end game score screen which shows if you were against a swf be it a 2 man 2 2 man 3 man or a 4 man i feel this would give us more data and less speculation and patterns could form realistically what will it prove sure you can gain data on swf matches versus solo but you will never know which matches those are until theyre over so would it really matter what knowledge would be gained that isnt already known and what would be gained from said knowledge every match with 4 man swf has a high probability of x every match with double swf has x probability etc i understand that but you dont know if it s swf before a match so said knowledge wouldnt make a difference within it beforehand it would just be speculation therefore how would it be useful you d still be playing a match and getting data as you play 1 2 2 2 is said data to be used to nerf swf somehow to prove what we already know swf is powerful to cast blame on a loss from because that is how people would abuse this information not to mention the additional abuse players would get for playing swf hey devs have all the data they want showing some extra intel to killers would suddenly decide them to act on swf also i do not get how this data could be abused simply put it gives the killer peace of mind knowing that they lost due to something out of their control it would yes but you have to consider the community as a whole people get death threats for simply playing well some people just cant handle that kind of information if they find theyre only playing swf and losing they wont play thus dropping sales 1 2 ,0

breaking a tiger has tested positive for covid 19 in new york any thoughts on how this happened 1 is covid 19 airborne 2 is this a case of human to animal transmission 3 is this a false positive result 4 is this due to 5g 5 other 2 it s also transmitted to pets cats dogs new research shows it s also transmitted among pets 5 other feline covid19 that s already around the world 1 yes as droplets and aerosol 2 seems lively need to analyse gene sequence 3 it could be 4 really 5g no david icke did a good job explaining 4 definitely them with their 5g there are other corona viruses that animals are more prone to getting so i m skeptical about it being covid19 maybe it is something that we all have from being sprayed 24 7 by who knows what maybe test the random squirrel or possum or rabbit maybe the entire planet has been exposed except for the super rich somehow they have been spared hmmmm 6 is the brave person who did the nasal swipe still alive and has both hands false positive like most tests just an extension of the fear narrative we actually already have the virus in us in different forms you could also test a monkey and they would more than likely test positive it affirms its just a virus that s assuming everything you read is the unvarnished truth covid 19 is probably a humanvirus that transmitted to animals mutated and transferred back to humans the virus rna is probably compatible with animal dna as well as human out of curiosity what is proposed link between mm 5g waves and 10nm viral particles food or water contaminated or airborne aerosols wait so a tiger can be tested for covid 19 but an ordinary citizen has to be near their death bed or have symptoms and prove they were in touch with someone who is already confirmed positive before they can have the test have a look through this for some logical and reasonable explanations regarding the pandemic fake news is my guess who would have the faintest idea what the false positive rate would be for the tiger species the reverend bayes would suggest false positive is most likely i don t wanna think abt what happened why are we using tests on tigers this story was later disproved as a hoax really john have you been locked up for too long it s 3g taking its revenge on 5g bullshit most likely bloody tiger fckers seriously though cats groom a lot so my guess would be infected zoo handler breathing coughing it onto an animal then big cat licking it off their fur coat ,0

confirmed had no criminal record hell that was confirmed the night of his murder by his mother what you didn t believe her and why in hell not and if he did his execution would have been justified right the media make me sick because if he s a thug he deserves to get shot while his hands were up with no weapon please ask if he was read his miranda rights when he was arrested last night things that don t matter rt confirmed had no criminal record does it matter confirmed had no criminal record it does for the ppl who assume about young black men as does your response this whole chain a necessary progression tell he robbed store assaulted owner then attacked police officer you gotta start somewhere ding ding ding no shit rt confirmed had no criminal record why do we need to confirm this rt confirmed had no criminal record wtf does this matter confirmed had no criminal record it makes no difference to me he didn t deserve to die with or without a record rip mike and even if did wtf does that have do with him being shot in the back and then shot more times in the front so having a criminal record justifies this killing why is this so important confirmed had no criminal record never thought he had one why would a stranger or anyone assume that answer racists bad police repubs haters confirmed had no criminal record that isn t surprising well something isn t adding up lol sigh rt confirmed had no criminal record and so the fuck what confirmed had no criminal record wow confirmed had no criminal record so that means he wasn t capable of assaulting an officer a criminal record starts somewhere confirmed had no criminal record and even if he did confirmed had no criminal record now what considering how hard it was for his parents to get him to finish hs i doubt he was clean confirmed no criminal record why the fuck does it matter and if he did doesn t matter rt confirmed had no criminal record so what if he had one would the shooting have been justified you seem shocked they are just desperately seeking an excuse to blame the victim not finding it so he was a good negro confirmed had no criminal record that s irrelevant anyway rt confirmed had no criminal record even if he did so what confirmed had no criminal record so if he did he would ve deserved it c mon rt confirmed had no criminal record ok and even if he had that still wouldn t have excused cop shooting him amp especially shooting until brown was dead which doesn t even matter whew now that we got that out of the way come on people really hands up sign of surrender and what the hell does that mean huh confirmed had no criminal record wtf charles manson has the right not to be gunned down so do our kids so this kid should not be gone confirmed had no criminal record even if he did who cares confirmed had no criminal record don t understand why that was really looked into and if he had confirmed had no criminal record confirmed had no criminal record gt gt gt who cares confirmed had no criminal record doesn t matter if he did his past can t be used against him placing the weight of his tragic death on the police department so if he had had would that have justified his execution has any1 checked if his executioner has any reprimands in his file he would not deserve 8 bullets for a car door mishap even with a record and if he did does that justify his murder it s sad this has to be stated one way or another as though he would have somehow deserved his fate even if he had one so fuckin what rt confirmed had no criminal record confirmed this shouldn t matter rt confirmed had no criminal record rt and if he did does that justify his murder no but it would speak of his character criminal record be damned at time of shooting he was walking down the street since when does that deserve a death penalty there have been rumourous posts floating around facebook the purpose of this is to clear the rumors yeah well all start out that way dont they what if he was white what the fuck rt confirmed had no criminal record huh confirmed had no criminal record oh wow like that should justify any unarmed person s murder anyways that has nothing to do with what took place at the time he was killed confirmed had no criminal record would a prior criminal record excuse this why does it matter anyway confirmed had no criminal record confirmed had no criminal record ohhp and if he had confirmed had no criminal record confirmed had no criminal record wow smh the police are the criminals confirmed had no criminal record if he dis though it would have been justified we all dodged a bullet there what will they use now confirmed had no criminal record real question is what is the shoters record is like confirmed had no criminal record but we knew that confirmed irrelevant brown reached for the officer s gun interesting according to officer or eyewitness confirmed had no criminal record relevant because no but i want to amplify this bc some rwnjs are smearing him right now dayum and if he had a criminal record it gives no cop or anybody to gun him down why the fuck would it have mattered confirmed had no criminal record journalists please show up pd to express intent to sue re violation of 1st amend and if he fucking did did it matter though confirmed had no criminal record not that having a criminal record would have justified murder by cop it s irrelevant it shouldn t matter if he had a record even folks w felonies shouldn t get executed in the street okay rt confirmed had no criminal record reports as spam rt confirmed had no criminal record confirmed had no criminal record man the background checks you gotta survive even after death what matters is he was unarmed amp not committing a crime it matters sadly to have brown as innocent as can be to our public it heightens the obvious police criminality confirmed had no criminal record and and you know what it wouldn t change a goddamn thing if he did exactly confirmed had no criminal record confirmed had no criminal record let alone wrestling a cop police killed an unarmed man who had his arms in the air whether he had a criminal record is of no relevance period tell en sunny another lie the ferguson put out to cover their killer cop cops this isn t even relevant it s sad that the worth of a young black man s life is conditional this supports that he was a gentle giant who didn t pick fights or get into trouble my god this is y i don t like cops why if he had to shot him in leg not kill him in cold blood i am 65 white woman shame shame r u serious considering how hard it was for his parents to get him to finish hs i doubt he was clean confirmed had no criminal record did it matter even if he did it would justify killing him confirmed had no criminal record time to turn to jesus how is this relevant even if he did y does that matter confirmed had no criminal record why would it matter confirmed had no criminal record it didn t matter neway this matters rt confirmed had no criminal record more troubling is the implication that gunning down a citizen without due process is acceptable with a record no justification for behaving as they do criminal are the police in if he did then rt confirmed had no criminal record and that is relevant because why confirmed had no criminal record and if he did he deserved to die we need d name of d cup what would it matter if he had had his hands in the air what happened to pepper spray amp tazors i d love to see his school discipline record this tweet shows the essence of white privilege if he did would he deserve to die doesn t matter if he did don t perpetuate that former criminals deserve to be shot and confirmed had no criminal record thx for confirmation agreed confirmed it shouldn t matter if he had a record this news won t help the situation in he was still wrongfully killed confirmed had no criminal record dont matter and confirmed had no criminal record exactly what does his background have to do with what happened i swear these news outlets smh as if we needed to solidify his deservingness and if he had confirmed had no criminal record i bet ferguson pd pissed he got a clean record can t try to use oh he was a thug as an excuse lock the killer cop up already as if it should matter confirmed had no criminal record ok of course they would check confirmed had no criminal record confirmed had no criminal record omg awww sad man ,0
what does this mean the rides are free will be paying the drivers the increased rate out of their own pocket yeah i think so they re getting 100 riders aren t wearing diff good gesture poor message transmission it is an illegal bloody service why don t you thank regular taxi drivers encouraging theft are we how about paying your drivers extra to go into the cbd instead of forcing others to pay extra to travel into potential danger so is uber paying for the rides paying the drivers you really gotta stop the swarm model or at least have someone actually look at why an area is swarming so are rides free or more expensive your tweet is very unclear faster backflip than tony abbott when you first became aware of the situation you tweeted that prices will increase what do you pay your drivers reports around the world flooding in of your 400 fare increase in response to a siege situation smart hikes prices during the how is that helping giving away free rides would help thank you for fixing this situation glad i m not the only one who s confused who s paying then so free or surge pricing ,0

part 9 can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air see previous answer on how does covid 19 spread part 5 older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness people with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention part 10 can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however part 11 many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill part 12 who is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of covid 19 and will continue to share updated findings part 13 can i catch covid 19 from the feces of someone

hector i m still trying to find the science on elimination do you have anything to suggest elimination is even possible giesecke indicates elimination is not possible all i ve found is this unfortunately it seems people lockdowns it s the micawber strategy drifting in the forlorn hope that something will turn up it s neither what it is is what it always is preservation of political party and that is central to the strategy it doesn t have to be consistent it doesn t have to be anything at all but it does have to keep them popular with the voters true but they re no longer popular with me the strategy can be found in art of war not sun tzu s version rather the grand old duke of york s version if only they d called it organic community based immunity immunity for the many not the few after october when millions join the dole queue taxes skyrocket we plunge into a devastating recession and the suicide rate soars lockdown will look indefensible and social distancing will be ignored by all but a minority of fannies government policy will be irrelevant elimination of a functioning economy that is and probably quite a few innocent people in the process flu will come in the winter and it will probably be called the second wave flu effects up to 1 billion people a year rather more than this c19 is but a smokescreen we are seeing an exercise in controlling the population whilst changing our laws to remove freedom of movement choice and thought if you don t think what s taking place is sinister and dangerous you haven t been paying attention question is way too sensible amp therfore beyond msm so called journalists got to be herd immunity because come october november when everybody s made up with cold what they gonna do what we gonna do self isolate for 2 week with a cold because of all the bedwetters the former was indeed the original plan when there will be less pressure on hospital beds and intensive care units due to ordinary winter flu demands soon afterwards they changed to latter plan and never explained why follow the opinion polls is the strategy strategy you poor optimist you their policy is r can t go above 1 which essentially means the latter and they don t give a damn if they end up enforcing endless lockdowns even though wn immunity levels have likely blocked it s growth now anyway back at the beginning the cso said elimination was impossible amp herd immunity while not the policy was the enviable end result unless we found a vaccine merkel said the same i m pretty sure nobody will admit that now labour amp the media would go nuts if herd immunity is back not one so called journalist has taken these bastards to task i wish roger cook was still around he would ve fuckin nailed them your analysis is far too obvious ,0

so what is sweden pursuing exactly the strategy rests on a few pillars 1 lockdowns are wrong 2 you are delaying deaths into the future 3 we are building herd immunity 4 we can spread the virus safely debunked one by one and that s why they have always been strong opponents of lockdowns tegnell repeatedly said there was no evidence they would work i mean what have the lockdowns ever done for us and to be fair in theory it would have been an interesting question to explore back in march are we sure they help but we did not have a eu sized laboratory nor the time to get data in we had to act first all we had is a control group sweden which did not do very well 1 as the bbc article demonstrates lockdowns greatly reduced the number of new cases in many countries they saved lives they bought us time they contained potential superspreader events and more 2 if you read the news in sweden in march they kept repeating that all the countries that went into lockdown will face a tragic second wave hence we were doing the right thing by carefully spreading the virus now let s put it that statement to test shall we denmark and norway and finland lifted their restrictions about the same days let s use may 11th dk and no as the ref one month ago how many more deaths have occurred in scandinavia since our neighbors exited lockdowns sw 1493 dk 74 fi 57 no 22 3 but we are smart we are building herd immunity side note the argument is so morally repugnant i won t even begin to unpack it as it reeks of social darwinism but let s try and keep it aside albeit difficult to keep aside anyhow let s go ahead herd immunity my a you should never allow a bunch of people who suck at math take a calculated risk it is spreading slower than much more painfully than thought before coda and it s not only the snapshot of today this week it s the direction that is worrisome today italy has found 202 new positive cases sweden 1 6th of the population 776 data as we stand today new cases 202 776 new deaths 71 67 currently in icu 249 283 sweden has 1 6 of the population however direction is important too sweden is nowhere near limiting the spread because surprise it has no intention to partly because we finally started testing more but largely because we have a lot of infections numbers are going up not down there is no bending the curve necessary in the fantasy land of the we should soon become immune people now both countries have a large cfr mortality for every 100 people found positive and to sweden s credit they have finally started testing more bravo but it s still high at 10 and our policy as it stands is designed to produce new infections in the range of 500 600 per day even if you dismissed the lab in stockholm as a statistical fluke how come swedes are accepting a magnitude of 20x the deaths of their nordic neighbors be still my heart ,0

9 can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air see previous answer on how does covid 19 spread corona virus thread 6 so how does the disease spread people can catch covid 19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid 19 coughs or exhales 7 these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth 8 people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick 10 can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low 11 however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill 12 what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease protection measures for everyone stay aware of the latest information on the covid 19 outbreak available on the who website and through your national and local public health authority 13 many countries around the world have seen cases of covid 19 and several have seen outbreaks authorities in china and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks 13 a however the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid 19 by taking some simple precautions 13 b regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water why washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands 13 c maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing why when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus 13 c if you are too close you can breathe in the droplets including the covid 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease ,0

5 everyone with covid 19 dies this statement is untrue as we have mentioned above covid 19 is only fatal for a small percentage of people in fact 80 face only mild symptoms with no need for hospitalization thread about some popular myths on corona virus 1 spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm disinfect surfaces not skin these cannot kill viruses within the body 2 older people gt 60 and young lt 14 are at risk sars cov 2 like other coronaviruses can infect people of any age however anyone with preexisting health conditions like cancer diabetes lung infections immunodeficiency is likely to get affected 6 cats and dogs spread coronavirus currently very little evidence however in hong kong a pomeranian whose owner had covid 19 became infected the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus 7 face masks protect against coronavirus disposable face masks may not provide protection yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly droplets can still enter the mouth and nose thus viral particles can also enter 8 hand dryers kill coronavirus hand dryers dont kill only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9 sars cov 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold all coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host which can be humans animals covid19 is thought to be passed from animals poultry to humans 9 2 thus some infect humans and many infect animals too the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans 10 antibiotics kill coronavirus antibiotics only kill bacteria and not viruses 14 thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons covid 19 symptoms only 2 10 days after infection and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with 15 flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid 19 as sars cov 2 is different than other viruses no existing vaccines protect against infection so please dont panic follow the govt rules of curfew isolation amp eat healthy finally dont forget to pray shambho mahadeva ,1

but mostly common around five 5 days how long does the virus survives on surfaces this virus may survive from few hours to several days under different conditions i type of surfaces ii temperatures or humidity of the place how coronavirus attacks cells in lungs the attacked cells are goblet cells which produce mucus that makes a wet slimy layer on your respiratory tract keeping your lungs moist ciliated cells have little hairs on them that wave in an upward direction so that any nasty material that gets stuck in the mucus bacteria virus particles of dust gets swept up towards your throat warning 1 the virus infects those cells and start to kill them 2 and as it kills them as part of its replication process tissues fall into the lungs and lungs start to get blockages and that blockage might mean the patient develops pneumonia 3 prof mark fielder once the virus has got into the pneumanic states in the lungs it can start causing problems in the air sacs in blood vessels in your lungs

still claiming covid 19 is just like the flu facts are such a pain aren t they surely your not actually advocating the forced removal of infected people from their homes against their will to separate infected from non infected people is the only way to stop such an epidemic selfish is the word it s not a mental health problem you have it s a chosen attitude that disregards the need to act collectively to stop the spread of the virus you think it s selfish to oppose detention without trial in response to a virus that is mild or harmless for 80 99 of those who become infected would you be happy to see your kids or partner hauled off to a sports stadium b c some official thinks they might be a carrier no i think it s selfish to argue people should make up their own minds about isolation and condemn many vulnerable innocent people to die this is the problem with rabid libertarians do you go into voluntary isolation every year during flu season if the answer is no do you think you are being selfish and possibly condemning vulnerable innocent people to die i m actually not saying that but let s look at the numbers somebody pointed out an apparent flaw based on nydoh ,1

part 6 how does covid 19 spread people can catch covid 19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid 19 coughs or exhales part 5 older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness people with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention part 7 these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 part 8 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings part

than through the air see previous answer on how does covid 19 spread part 10 can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however part 11 many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill part 12 who is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of covid 19 and will continue to share updated findings part 13 can i catch covid 19 from the feces of someone with the disease the risk of catching covid 19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low while initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases spread through this part 14 route is not a main feature of the outbreak who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid 19 is spread and will continue to share new findings part 15 because this is a risk however it is another reason to clean hands regularly after using the bathroom and before eating part 16 what can i do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease protection measures for everyone stay aware of the latest

mouth from there the virus can enter your body and can make you sick make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene part 21 this means covering your mouth and nose with your

where covid 19 is spreading widely if possible avoid traveling to places especially if you are an older person or have diabetes heart or lung disease why part 25 you have a higher chance of catching covid 19 in one of these areas protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited past 14 days areas where covid 19 is spreading follow the guidance outlined above protection measures for part 26 everyone self isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell even with mild symptoms such as headache low grade fever 37 3 c or above and slight runny nose until you recover if it

q what can i do to protect myself from a declare we are in pandemic and stop wasting time it is great you are disseminating this info but it doesn t tackle the global problem of new world locations becoming the next victims think about countries who will be defenseless if they don t get right support don t only stay away from people with fevers how should we know asymptomatic people also spread the virus in the air everyone needs to stay in their home for 2 months china knows without stopping travelling it s useless firts changing the direction director and all the epidemiology workers avoid shaking hands here is our guide for individual community and national response plot that shows the success in china to date you may do wudu five times a day to protect yourself from as explained here tofeel obtain live declare secretmeanof immaterial flawless heavenly healthy individual community cosmic holy born family life certificate tofeel obtain live declare secretholymeanof atomic circulation levelevent at cell vibration for all creational species msjchatterleylertur your advice is garbage you re the only one saying the virus spreads through droplets everyone else including new york medical staff know that coronavirus is airborne coronavirus cdc coverup in ny state gt gt plz there is no control no quarantine everyone is in danger plz plz help we are from junior high school so sad listen new news that daegu is the second wuhan so what about our idea make real as soon as who would you like to help daegur can drink zam zam water eat qurma fruits please monitor the behavior of the iranian ministry of health in relation to coronavirus please persuade iran to quarantine qom province please persuade the iranian government to report the actual statistics of coronavirus infections and deaths not false from iran you guys gotta stop using clip art please rename the organization in winnie pooh organization thanks declare it is a pandemic already hibernate q what is your classification system for pandemics if you don t use phase 6 anymore you are killing us declare the pandemic are the masks really helpful people are wearing n99 masks for safety these days what about protection against influenza abd measles we already have protections for both of those a hibernate like a bear until this passes i ve an urgent question due to the answer to one of the questions about the ways of protection against covid_19 a big misunderstanding occured about using or not using vitamin c since the answer including the things which may be harmful like alcohol smoking and herbal tea and taking vitamin c got viral in iran i wanted you to clarify the answer again is vitamin c useful to increase the quality of immune system or it is harmful in this case of covid_19 thanks for sharing in iran we need the urgent intervention of the world health organization to prevent disaster this government has no crisis management at all i am absolutely appalled by the lack of measures put in place at train stations and airports across europe strict checks should be in place at every large city for both departures and arrivals in order to mitigate the risk of virus carriers spreading the disease i travelled from london to milan and paris to london the last few days milan only arrival passengers are being monitored for the disease while paris gare du nord has no measures in place whatsoever what is being done to fight this global pandemic the image is to small to read declare a pandemic face mask hand washing and less social activity a do not believe a single word from and stop wasting time declare a pandemic before this gets out of hand reinfection has already been confirmed worse the cause is unknown the virus can persist in the body even after being cured in the lesions of the organs and reactivate when immunity decreases first don t trust wuhan health organization it s very likely that that covid 19 becomes iran needs immediate help and support healthcare providers are suffering from huge shortage of masks and proper infection prevention materials a disaster is happening in iran please start a campaign to help them at least by providing n95 masks when are we declaring pandemic lost our nerve i might be crazy but declaring it a pandemic might help but what do i know no declaring it an pandemic won t help as it is not an pandemic 24 feb 2020 updated forecast of the epidemic of a from the city of china if the infection acceleration will persists then by november 26 2021 7 7 billion people may become infected 432 million people can die from the virus this kind of virus is dangerous for china people only because it was made by human beings against other human beings what do you mean by not having a process to declare pandemic its an essence of your job to inform about diseases so what the hell what happened to your daily media conference the virus can be transferred thru droplets it can be transmitted through aerosols if you re in the same room as some1 amp they are breathing the same air you can get the virus masks amp eyewear are key it can be transmitted through urine amp faeces don t use public toilets the only advice for the world is don t trust who and learn from hkprotesters and taiwan don t believe any news from ccp hkg and who hk have exp from sars which also infect by china and ccp lie on the history and pretend they are savior don t let them play this trick again its a pandemic announce it as such for the sake of god you were supposed to be in iran today can anyone tell us what s going on have you

first cases who finally woke up are you not worried with political correctness anymore first change director tedrosold liar god you guys are useless a closed china s borders earlier u can wash your hands as much as you want but evidence indicates to the virus being transferable by aerosols the diamond princess and a case in a hong kong flat suggest it is being transferred via the air not just

6 cats and dogs spread coronavirus currently very little evidence however in hong kong a pomeranian whose owner had covid 19 became infected the dog did not display any symptoms and this leads to an imp ques to differentiate infection from virus thread about some popular myths on corona virus 1 spraying chlorine or alcohol on skin kills viruses in the body applying alcohol or chlorine to the body can cause more harm disinfect surfaces not skin these cannot kill viruses within the body 2 older people gt 60 and young lt 14 are at risk sars cov 2 like other coronaviruses can infect people of any age however anyone with preexisting health conditions like cancer diabetes lung infections immunodeficiency is likely to get affected 7 face masks protect against coronavirus disposable face masks may not provide protection yes it is better than nothing but most masks dont fit properly droplets can still enter the mouth and nose thus viral particles can also enter 8 hand dryers kill coronavirus hand dryers dont kill only soap and water is the best way followed by alcohol based sanitizers to protect oneself 9 sars cov 2 is just a mutated form of the common cold all coronaviruses belong to family of coronoviridae and have surface spike proteins that help them invade host which can be humans animals covid19 is thought to be passed from animals poultry to humans 9 2 thus some infect humans and many infect animals too the best way to avoid such infections is stop eating meat and follow a more satvik diet this suggestion may draw flak from others but thats the truth sars and mers were also passed 4m animals to humans 10 antibiotics kill coronavirus antibiotics only kill bacteria and not viruses 14 thermal scanners can diagnose coronavirus thermal scanners can detect only fever that can be caused by many reasons covid 19 symptoms only 2 10 days after infection and an infection person maybe completely normal to begin with 15 flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against covid 19 as sars cov 2 is different than other viruses no existing vaccines protect against infection so please dont panic follow the govt rules of curfew isolation amp eat healthy finally dont forget to pray shambho mahadeva ,1
