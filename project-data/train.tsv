misconceptions 1 covid 19 is just like the flu another strain of the flu 2 covid 19 is not as infectious nor as deadly as the seasonal flu 3 younger individuals should not be worried about the virus of greater concern to younger individuals and in fact everyone should be the expected reemergence of covid 19 in this coming fall 4 the reemergence of infectious diseases in the fall typically is accompanied by mutations to the infectious agent enabling it to infect all individuals young and old and typically more virulent as well 5 which brings me to point 4 the actions mandated by public health officials schools and businesses worldwide are by no accounts an overreaction the prevention of the spread of disease not only helps our health professionals hospitals and public health organizations treat individuals but also decreases risk of mutations in covid 19 which would be responsible for a reemergence of covid 19 in the fall able to severely affect all individuals as the more covid 19 is able to replicate in a host the more likely a beneficial mutation from perspective of the virus is to arise 6 the stopping of the spread of covid 19 now is crucial to preventing the spread later and for protecting the elderly immunocompromised and those with pre existing conditions it should also be noted that not extending the course of the covid 19 virus in the population disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic statuses and those who are more likely to return to their workplace as a result of financial need leading to increased spread 7 8 i would never make a claim to be an expert on this topic and i applaud and look up to those who have spent their lives conducting research on infectious diseases i am however passionate about this particular area of science and passionate about education and educating the general public about infectious diseases i highly encourage everyone of you to do your research educate yourself on how you can best help yourself your family and your community the efforts to stop the spread of this disease begin on the individual level and are part of a global effort the actions of individuals today will have resounding impacts in months and years to come i urge you to be safe and think of others in addition to yourself references 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ,1

cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus there is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases the normal human body temperature remains around 36 5 c to 37 c regardless of the external temperature or weather by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes mouth and nose the new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose to protect yourself clean your hands frequently with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water also avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus no hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 ncov to protect yourself against the new coronavirus you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water once your hands are cleaned you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever i e have a higher than normal body temperature because of infection with the new coronavirus however they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus no spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes i e eyes mouth be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus no vaccines against pneumonia such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b hib vaccine do not provide protection against the new coronavirus the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 ncov and who is supporting their efforts although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 ncov vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus no there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold however regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties however there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus does the new coronavirus affect older people or are younger people also susceptible people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus 2019 ncov older people and people with pre existing medical conditions such as asthma diabetes heart disease appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus no antibiotics do not work against viruses only bacteria the new coronavirus 2019 ncov is a virus and therefore antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment however if you are hospitalized for the 2019 ncov you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co infection is possible are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus to date there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus 2019 ncov however those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners pls don t panic people with fake news because it s not real all facts are in these threads ,0

45 000 people died last year in the us in 7 weeks and that hasn t stopped and its not gotten worse so what is covid 19 one thing i think we ve learned about the covid 19 data is that we should not declare that we ve passed the peak based on 2 3 days of data and yet every week sat mon i watch people declare that the worst is over the worst of what what is covid 19 there isnt dispute that 90 of healthy people recover so what are we talking about hospitals arent overrun we arent over the worst of what i guess 45 000 people dead in 7 weeks in the us and it s not stopping any time soon it s getting ramped up here in ky overall deaths are up troll by 2x to 4x in affected areas thank you for the facts ,0

how can i grocery shop safely in the time of i disinfect everything with a solution of water and jik before bringing it into the house is it unnecessary can t you allow the stores to sell us printers and ink as part of the essentials we need to print school stuff for our children makro is now also selling printers and cartridges just wish pna or something were open so i can get more stationery and books for my grader r child i wipe my grocery contents with a dish cloth then wash it with soap and hot water though most shops spray sanitizer on entrance it s just an extra measure i take to protect my family many of us buy bread everyday from local spazashop we can t sanitize or wash it with soap thank you minister how long does the virus last on surfaces i usually leave my grosery in the garage and take it out the next day except if it needs refrigeration i like the idea rather be safe than sorry i use a wet wipe with soap on everything i buy especially groceries can t take chances when factory and personnel are testing positive every day and not all of them wear masks when unpacking so why have you banned prepared cooked food from etc essential to many people and no more danger than any other essential food items right because of the competition act ttansmission via food packaging is not known yet but there is evidence the virus can stay on surfaces for periods of time minister pls tell us are there any deaths that were reported of ppl who died without a testing thanks for confirming that there s no reason to believe food packaging can transmit covid 19 until we get the first case rather be safe why cant i buy prepared food at the grocery shop they say it s not fair as far as the competition act that no prepared food can be can be sold that s why restaurants are closed because we can cook please all those found to be positive must be taken to quarantine together with immediately families otherwise we will have countless numbers adding if that is not done can we follow the rules on quarantine and social distancing published by st georges unviversitu of london they seem to be much safer than what we are doing now they recommend a 2m distance and also they steps and guidelines in disinfecting consultation rooms and test centers if there is no confirmed case passed through food or food packaging then why are restaurant takeaways not allowed prevention is better than cure i rinse and wipe everything at home before storing i m still going to sanitize all food packages and throw away the plastic used to carry all that grocery who did once mention there is no evidence of human2human transmission look at us now this is said that s not even r500 not all basic foods are covered there so what about those people who resists like when you distance yourself from them they keep following you i was queuing for shoprite money market when i told some people to keep distance from me and they refused what should we do about people like that only us can save lifes i would just let them go in front if i were you beautiful slides presentation continue forward to which you add choose items that promote health not sickness so stop with the sugar flour vegetable oils and rice why are the police demanding permits when we want to buy groceries just tell people to disinfect everything dude even groceries khabazela siyabonga be strong as as always its hard lot of ppl in one shop get together no distance dear minister thank you for amazing work my question is do i need a permit to go buy food essentials minister you gotta restrct this grocery thing bcz ppl are buying evryday what have you guys done to minimize the street beggars that are wondering the streets of south africa we are not safe anymore when we go out and get some essentials around ghandi square please help us thank you in advance well would be safe if i didn t have to drive 50 minutes to go and try to buy cigarettes thank you we will try our best excellent when i read the heading i thought it was a protection guide from sandf saps amp metro cops on the kasi streets thank you so much minister we must abide with the rules so that we can flatten the curve surely then all food should be available to be sold i have a question yesterday someone with a mask was sneezing at the shop and l had one too what are the chances of contracting the virus is at all she was infected doc but it said the virus can survive on plastic and paper surfaces for up to 2 to 3 days sir do i need a permit to be able to get essentials atleast you are able to monitor mine are in rural areas in limpopo they left their books behind and are seriously impacted now for them it s a long holiday i wish i could be given permission to travel and help them login to their portals my mother is old i place paper on the table all packets are placed on the paper i wipe down or spray each and every item purchased especially fridge items rather be safe than sorry wash hands thoroughly after but retailers are still not allowed to sell cooked food during lock down of course not if it can be found on an object surface what can stop it to be found on food packaging my minister say there are no cases confirmed from food packaging from the cases that are currently confirmed is there a method to test where how and when they have occurred hello dr why can t we all get tested because it dsnt get better i m not sure of this news about 24 dis chem workers i m so scared at the moment how many customers has this virus who was at that dis chem how long is covid 19 going to last in sa retail staff and merchies are not social distancing they always standing together in the aisles chatting sharing phone screens etc very worrying gauteng needs total shutdown please instruct retailers to issue their staff with face masks we cannot stay 1m away from cashiers when paying dr according to you the inevitable outcome for us all is testing positive for covid 19 this means even if i test negative today i can still get it tomorrow so how do we trust your fellow colleagues who will apparently be testing us with pick n pay you can order online and they deliver at your doorstep that s how i ve been shopping is the key to helping more people thank u minister we will do our best i also sanitize everything i buy from the grocery shop my kids call me paranoid maybe i am people should also learn to touh items they actualy plan on taking buying rather must you also wash your clothes when returning from shops i read this somewhere haven t done it though i wish i can be part of grocery shopper but hey we did not get paid our march salaries by i don t even have electricity food and other basic essentials and the most important thing is to wear a mask because any customer or cashier could be an asymptomatic carrier you ve got to wear a mask because when you speak there are always droplets coming out of your mouth i always try to disinfect everything with bleach solution when i get home now explain the and patel ignorance why izitolo kuthiwe zingasithengiseli ukudla okuphekiwe minister stop the lies may i ask where and how do i report an employer who is violating the covid 19 rules

stop giving in to muslim s well kfc has offended me by bending over u s making same mistakes that europe has give 1 they take 1 mile hahaha kfc in for a huge shock when they ban kfc altogether not just the wipes go to chick fil a instead we need to stop changing our way of life to appease everyone with a quirk let them lick their left hands then good heavens what a bunch of freaks congrats on your 250 tweet is this in the uk if this shit comes to us i will never eat again kfc is most likely only a subsidiary franchise when ye consider ruling factors of th s fortunately tweeting seems to be turning the tide because kfc know their uk market kfc is a business bye bye ms american pie go to chik filet popeyes churches or a local deli of some type probably better anyway if only that s already happening in australia there s hahal only browns chickens too bc they buy them amp then they have somewhere to patronize if you sell food in birmingham amp it s not halal you sell less food demand side economics profit motive some ignorant pc lefty decision obviously made by someone who doesn t understand islam or muslims immigration is good but you emigrate to live a different life and simulate the culture of the land and laws why are there islam controlled uk cities then the muslims go home and drink in private hypocrites to the max islam bans drinking alcohol do kfc provide wipes to suck on this is a joke right this stupidity has got to stop don t use a wipe use a muslim or have i read this wrong which customers do they need the most muslims or everyone else that has been their customers for decades amp never burned one this isn t true fyi in case anyone is still interested in what s factual agree stop the evil religion amp government via amp poor ole colonel is no doubt rolling in his grave ban kfc and cancel passports of all britishers who do not booze no more kfc place is garbage food anyhow lt lt see what you have done not listening to customers breaks balls getting it yet easily the stupidest story i ve read in awhile ppl are clueless alcohol is essential for disinfection ffs satire or are just thick eat mor chickin no keep going and maby you get behead so go support them no more kenfucky fried chicken for me i eat american only not some muslim hugging chicken strange i m a nurse amp never once did a muslim patient ask me not to use an alcohol wipe before an injection i am israel simplified disagree see amp gt negative then we lose ground we fight and take back whats ours either they abide by our rules or they can leave its all so utterly petty drives me insane just their way of pushing sharia shit lol re elbows false economic counter jihad is needed what are u kidding me they really did that kfc wish i hadn t spent my money at your place today they are too sensitive amp that s a fact where s their tolerance i don t eat their originally secret too damn greasy chicken it means there is a market shows you how many are there kfc halal branches listed here rest are non halal why no labels and subway 200 stores have taken pork prducts off of menur ban chicken next tell the muslims to stop eating the darned wipes they ll be stoping our supermarkets supplying pork next because it offends them what a fucking joke the colonel would be turning in his grave if they don t like it piss off why do we keep pandering to these people r u kidding me they sure have a lot of clout here the ban islam crap is a bit much the hand wipes are equally a bit much what that is retarded ukip is basically just made up of former tories nothing changes but the name have we all gone mad i don t eat the stuff anyway its chickens have elbows some people need to get a fucking reality check customers should ask and refuse halal kill them economically i thought muslims don t eat pork whats with the wipes i like there biscuits pass the damn bacon if the muslims are idiotic enough to suck on the wipes it s their problem not kfc s well said and how come they are never offended by the benefits they claim from us infidels gt lt can it ban muslims if they don t like what we have well they can just move back to the hell hole they came from r shut up that seems very extreme diverse cultures have an option to partake or abstain if u disagree don t use them people who eat in kfc s are the sort of people who make love to vacuum cleaners read the article properly it was a member of staff american style chicken offends me has to be british or is like sponsoring terrorists have you noticed the lack of skin on chicken portions in your local smkt ffs the kfcs in mid east give out wet wipes in my limited experience of mid east kfcs uk gone mad priv corp so not a big deal in my mind they need to accommodate the market share they want check out chick fil a must better than kfc what s next a burqa for the colonel no female employees why not tofu chicken so as not to offend peta yes stamp it out now or it really will be too late it s a terrible story it really is i never saw animal rights activists protest halal the most cruel method to kill animals birds for meat dumb question why do muslims hate alcohol ban it in hospitals too horrible stuff tried all sorts of mixers with it too the religion of sucks so does and there s alcohol in them they give them away free demand bacon at kfc kentucky fried cr p fed up of having other religions rammed down my throat if i wanted to be a muslim i would become one kfc off my list then cheers i am an american offended by obama just how ridiculous can we get this all pisses me off tell them to go home if they don t like how we live i m vegie anyhow erm i think islamic world pioneered use of alcohol for medical purposes it s consumption that s forbidden you guys are turning into france wipes are not required to be used are they smile tell the fussies where the dry napkins are and who can i help next the once great british empire will be dirt roads and mud huts in a hundred years if not sooner it s not consumable alcohol ie ethanol what s next screenwash that s right patriot we need to let the corporates who really is in charge in america that being we the american people a muslim leader said banning of wipes was bizarre and kfc have apologised so no need to stop visiting is disgusting anyway that s the main reason to ban them dafuq they don t even know the diff between rubbing alcohol and drinking alcohol rl idiocracy what kind of drivel is this you re spouting there he boycotted alcohol wipes zibidi get deported not aware of that religion from the thats exactly why the problem exists because people have i for one have had enough when in rome stupid if an alcohol wipe offends then i guess they should just use their shit covered hands to eat the halal crap it already is when the likes of anjem chowdry freely roam the streets of londonistan why boycott them over a staff members mistake not policy you need the wipes for greasy chicken a it was a halal kfc think kosher targeted to muslim customers not a regular kfc b it was staff error isn t it rubbing alcohol the stuff that ll make you go blind you if you drink it wow they didn t tell them that the chicken is cooked in pig lard lmao never use the place so won t get rich on me i ll overlook it as long as they come through with those kentucky fried pork rinds they ve been planning had free food at the kc on saturday avoided that hal al shite this is stupid though muslims just can t consume alcohol there s nothing wrong with hand wipes containing alcohol ,1

ny nj ct continue to trend down in daily new cases even as many other states have either stopped their downward trend or inflected upward since the mass protests started estimates of prevalence are 20 25 well below the herd immunity threshold so what is going on is an issue but i am not sure the situation warrants the kind of hopelessness and unpredictability conveyed here to paraphrase jonathan haidt this is the coddled american mind the preamble of political opinions about masks etc makes me wonder if the hopelessness as you point out is intended to make a political point it seems like a tactic to scare ppl into wearing masks yeah those were the elements that made me think that btw speaking of your contempt for epidemiologists there is something very interesting going on that they need to get into the bottom off it is not just mask compliance i have noticed in nj increasing socialization and crowding in public places as the state has reopened yet we don t detect a pickup in cases could it be that herd immunity can be reached at lower levels than thought or perhaps seroprevalence estimates are missing true infection attack rates it is quite puzzling but i see no attempts to engage with it by epidemiologists ,0
what is wrong with this guy we have plenty of testing so much testing that sites shut down from lack of demand the goalposts constantly shift for team apocalypse no amount of testing serology testing contact tracing anything will satisfy their desire for safety no a just government protects our rights you want a mommy to care for you america was founded by men who wanted to live free and the stupid thing about testing is that if a person is found not to have the virus that day he could get it the next so it s pretty pointless their retort to that would be well then we need even more testing serology testing no reopening until we have a vaccine two more weeks until the healthcare system collapses there s just no reasoning with them which makes this all the more frustrating ,0

sonko it s you and you alone sonko anapendwa ballot bado atashinda please tell that alcohol when ingested acts primarily at the cns level and hence his objective of dealing with coronavirus through issuance of alcoholic drink is cosmetic hii mask yake ni gani is this really necessary you can put that cost into a better use alcohol is a luxury at this point in time drunken master life is good and funny sometimes na hiyo mask yote kwa kichwa spitting nonsense later ajipate akiwa na covid19 sonko is right alcohol suppreses virus when used above 60 in hand sanitizer but when taken ametupa mbao na randa moderate alcohol consumption reduces your risks of developing and dying of heart disease which if you get corona you ll die so the sonko is right am ashamed to have voted you in ushindwe ,0

my question is why do we need to have a desert cult faith anyway regardless of anything jesus may have said or done why do we need it why not use our own religion that we ve used since our beginning i didn t vote in 2016 trump has a fanatical fan base of judeo christians what can you do in a nation where over 80 of boys are circumcised as infants because muh bible says so duuude 1 jesus forbid circumcision even if he was circumcised against his will it s the protestants who reintroduced it because they follow judaïsm and not catholicism which by the way was 100 anti judaïsm until the free masons infiltrated it and changed it from the inside during 2 the renaissance the americans are the most stupid and evil people on earth nothings to do with religions they are the sewer of europe the worst of the worst convicts rapists murderers crooks etc 3 europe didn t want them and unfortunately didn t exterminate them instead they sended them to the new world new jerusalem and since then they fuck up the world even more than the jews 4 i m not christian but jesus hated the jews that s why they had him killed christianism is a poison yes but jesus was not part of it he was a jew who hated his own race like so many more jews we don t need to have a desert cult faith i never said that we only need to get rid of them once and for all and varg is right but the problem is even without christianism the jews will still control us they are everywhere not just in christianism ,0

well then why do we need it doesn t the average router in everyone s house carry a frequency of 2 5 and 5ghz say it did increase to 60ghz or even 300ghz what would be the effects of it on people and animals the 5g conspiracy muppets who were responsible for this damage should see serious jail time and not only for criminal damage but also just for being unintelligent delusional arseholes when will these anti everything tin foil hat wearing clowns wake up 5g has been proven as being a health risk to people especially those with weak immune systems it will also remove your privacy and freedom do your research that s what you re good at niall don t fall into the narrative trap help spread the truth no it hasn t there is no proof regarding 5g you are absolutely correct there is no proof its dangerous or safe the lack of safety testing concerns me i know we all have mobile phones wifi routers microwaves and several other devices that transmit some kind of radio waves but 5g is at least 10 times the strength and is a radio signal which can do absolutely no harm to you can you back that up yes i can considering i work in the field myself do you so is it true they operate at 60ghz and above the same frequency as a military ray gun no thats a myth we have no where that came from 5g can carry a frequency up to 300ghz but the frequency range that will be used for 5g will be between 3 3ghz and 4 2ghz let me put it another way i am assuming you have wifi at home and during this lockdown have you noticed it being a bit slower than normal that s due to the volume of people logging on which in turns makes it slower 5g removes that i understand that the wifi is slower at the moment and if everything goes back to normal it will return to normal the 4g on my network hasn t really changed i also don t believe that 5g is covid it is just coincidental that this is happening at the same time 4g runs around 2 8 ghz while i do agree why do we need it now we do need it in the future because of the improvement in speed and download time ,0

right but individual responsibility requires individual responsibility these idiots are advocating football games going to the beach and movie theaters they believe covid 19 is just like the flu and refuse to take responsibility for their thinking or actions the president uses vague calls to action so he can avoid responsibility and later claim he meant something else just yesterday he was outlining a phased approach for opening up america again he should be specific about his concerns which measures are okay and which are not how about just an emphasis on individual responsibility again it s ok to educate on wearing gloves and masks and staying inside without enforcing it as law true but it s hard to trust people to not go if the idiots keep swarming toward them the whole thing about freedom is it comes with responsibility a society filled with people who are incapable of exercising freedom without hurting others is a doomed society ,1

coronavirus at the same time there are many types of diseases that make our immune system weaker i don t know if this virus makes the same but if so this is possible question here once infection starts does a virus attenuate other than mutation to a point as it is spread from person to person and not increase in potency as sort of a general rule of the virus world this virüs is a global level dangerous we should be also wear mask greetings from china are surgical masks effective protection and how to use them properly which side goes where please name this virus constant confusion about

a different composition and composition and multiply differently from bacteria antibiotics work by targeting the mechanisms of bacterial growth not viruses to kill or kill specific bacteria during

with significant movement back and forth ignored by who and china they got to work still today less than 50 cases and 1 death now preparing for influx from other countries request for clarification from while antibiotics won t treat the underlying covid 19 virus antibiotics are used to treat bacterial pneumonia one of several potential symptoms individuals have exhibited as a consequence of contracting the coronavirus correct more most likely been around long long time as just now a test 4 19 antibiotics work with bacterial infections not viral ones so that s obvious there is evidence that treatment with antibiotics can provide supportive care from secondary infections and should be used once severe symptoms develop ,0

q is wearing rubber gloves while out in the public effective in preventing the new coronavirus infection maybe they re scaring you but i find it helpful for the media amp govt to share updates if a hurricane was coming i d expect regular updates on wind speeds storm path stories of the devastation its caused elsewhere same with which is a much bigger storm can be effective in a way that you don t want to touch face while wearing gloves it is not pleasant there are no dumb questions could provide a false sense of protection health workers especially are trained to not touch their face or anything really if wearing gloves they would benifit from the habit okay sir thank you does the virus nest in our hair should i wash my hair every day when i come back home did china s economic growth emerge as the corona virus dead link latex gloves are lethal for those with serious latex allergies especially the powdered ones that can cause airborne anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals no but it shows us who does the housework they misunderstood the question no one is going to touch their face while wearing gloves as a reminder wear gloves it s protection and you won t touch your face but they have to be disposed of meticulously then ok just say it you dont want us the general public to buy all the masks and gloves because the health care professionals need them to treat people with coronavirus i wont trust you guys at all kolonya kullanın useless organization what does the coronavirus smell like this guy says we must not stop to give hughs here in méxico unfortunately this guy is a big nation president please kindly test ginger against corona asap please try test ginger against it ,0

point to the specofic system where the issue resides and what the issue is then we can talk about it i may even be on your side but to say the results must be an overall systemic problem is pretty vague not sure how you expect any change when that is what you tout those people are wasting their time that could be better spent on something that actually exists i see hundreds of thousands of black people with amassed wealth much greater than my own and good for them no issues with that from me i see hundreds of thousands of black business owners i see a higher education system that does everything it possibly can to recruit talented black people i see companies that go out of their way to hire minorities most importantly i see the constitution where it says all men are equal finally systemic racism is a thing of the past let me be clear i am not saying there was not a time that it doesn t exist but we led the way in abolishing it am i saying there is not a racist out there here and there that work in these industries you tour as flawed at their core no i m not saying that because that would be ridiculous if you are trying to get rid of all the racists in the world i fear you are going to be sorely disappointed in your ability to mold an individual to what you want them to be racists come in all shapes sizes and colors and should be called out for what they are but as individuals not by burning down the systems and institutions that made this country great in the first place racism in our institutions is illegal and if you can point me to a specific instance where a minority person was targeted or excluded solely because of the color of their skin i will be the first person to stand right next to you and demand justice for that person but the whole thought that the systems are built and maintained to keep minorities down right here right now is just completely false and all too often used to diminish the responsibility of an individual to chose what they do with their life people are put in shitty situations regardless of skin color has more to do with poverty and parents than anything some people decide to break the cycle and make something of themselves others do not has nothing to do with the amount of melanin in their skin and all about their willingness to succeed anyway i am sure this all falls on deaf ears regardless but trying to explain my position because you asked the mortgage deal has been debunked countless times prison population couldn t be a result of crimes committed i hear you when you say they are sentenced more harshly whats the answer don t commit crime in the first place would be a novel place to start for any race ,0

how does covid 19 spread people can catch covid 19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid 19 coughs or exhales what are the symptoms of covid 19 the most common symptoms of covid 19 are fever tiredness and dry cough some patients may have aches and pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually some people become infected but don t develop any symptoms and don t feel unwell most people about 80 recover from the disease without needing special treatment around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness people with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid 19 by taking some simple precautions regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water why washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing why when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus if you are too close you can breathe in the droplets including the covid 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease avoid touching eyes nose and mouth why hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses once contaminated hands can transfer the virus to your eyes nose or mouth from there the virus can enter your body and can make you sick make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze then dispose of the used tissue immediately why droplets spread virus by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold flu and covid 19 stay home if you feel unwell if you have a fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical attention and call in advance follow the directions of your local health authority why national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections keep up to date on the latest covid 19 hotspots cities or local areas where covid 19 is spreading widely if possible avoid traveling to places especially if you are an older person or have diabetes heart or lung disease why you have a higher chance of catching covid 19 in one of these areas for more information please contact us e mail info com ,0

how does covid 19 spread at the moment we know that the virus is transmitted through contaminated droplets droplets of saliva or mucus carrying the respiratory virus can travel one to three metres through coughing or sneezing as of today 169 906 covid 19 cases have been confirmed resulting in 6 644 fatalities worldwide after its discovery last december in wuhan china the virus started to spread around the world causing panic how do the seven human coronaviruses differ the main difference lies in the severity of the illnesses they cause the first four respiratory viruses range from mild to medium while sars and mers can cause respiratory illness of high severity how do viruses work a virus is a protein box with genetic material inside which needs a living cell to replicate it enters the cell through binding with receptors and reprogrammes it to make copies of itself working as a template to replicate more viruses inside the body the virus needs to fully enter the respiratory tract for infection to happen but that s why the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding close contact with sick people washing your hands thoroughly greatly reduces the risk of infection there are reports that infection is possible through faeces and recirculated air ventilation systems and air conditioners but this has not been systematically studied so it is hard to say with 100 per cent certainty how deadly is the new coronavirus compared to sars mers and the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold we cannot determine this for certain as the apparent mortality rate is likely to be overestimated at the start of an outbreak because a lot of mild cases are missed also with covid 19 some people can be asymptomatic meaning the virus is not always detected and therefore not recorded the mortality rate for influenza is 0 1 per cent but since covid 19 is so new it remains to be seen just how many cases will turn out to be fatal it is commonly cited that in a given year with no complications influenza kills 500 000 people compared to the four respiratory coronaviruses the mortality rate for sars cov 2 is higher although compared to sars 9 6 per cent and mers 34 4 per cent covid 19 shows a low mortality rate but with a wider spread making the total number of deaths larger can summer or warmer temperatures help eradicate the virus for some respiratory viruses this does happen not because of the temperature but also thanks to the humidity and changes in social patterns of human beings in this case it is still premature to say ,0

when this pandemic infected 26 of the population worldwide it made me fear for my life but now it infected more than a hundred thousands of people millions of people to be exact what is covid 19 anyway it is a crisis that we all should take seriously this pandemic i became productive i learned how to decipher codes i get to watch a lot of animes and read many books i am happy because i get to spend more time with my family like watching movies eating together and talked and talked about everything this pandemic started and the true face of the people also started to unmask some families doesn t have a proper home some doesn t have the stable job to provide the need for their family and some doesn t have the privilege to protect themselves during this pandemic what about them there are people that are hoarding the necessities to what to benefit you from preventing the virus to re sell it at a higher price these people didn t even think about the people who doesn t have enough money to buy enough necessities for their family to be honest i got mad at them during this pandemic i also realized how bad our government is the president didn t even bother to tell us the plan at an early time instead he ordered the police and soldiers to kill everyone not obeying the rules i mean the people not obeying the rules are hungry they are waiting for the relief goods that was supposed to be distributed as soon as possible but nothing was distributed i also realized that no matter how bad and irresponsible you are if you have a position at the government and if you are rich you can wander freely everywhere spreading the virus and still be given compassion that you don t deserve this pandemic made me aware of the issues of what s really happening it angers me a lot to be honest because if you don t have the privilege you are going to be ignored like a pest that s how dirty the government works we already have the highest number of covid 19 cases in southeast asia with minimal testing without testing we re acting blind amp exposing the vulnerable old poor and the jobless i think that there will be no choice but to extend this lockdown we should all cooperate during this lockdown the government should provide our needs and necessities to prevent people from going outside we can overcome this situation by cooperating and puting our faith to god and the frontliners we also should give our biggest salute to our frontliners not only they are giving their absolute best but they are staking their lives as well reine elyssa g fodra stem 11 03 ,0

what is it for normal flu guessing it s pretty high given the extremely low average mortality rate for covid 19 i d expect the nnt to be over 10 000 maybe much higher once herd immunity is reached worldwide residual panic will no doubt help with sales agree meredith but when herd immunity takes over it will have fewer hosts my belief is that immunity from a real infection is greater than that achieved from a vaccine covid is so contagious that herd will occur prior to a vaccine ,0

y all i just read that abc paid darren wilson 500k for the interview destroying black life remains a lucrative american career which means cnn was outbid and i believe he s already garnered over half a million from his gofundme campaign no wonder people are all chanting fuck cnn fuck kstp and so on what a stupid tweet crazy a slap in face of victim and his family worst performance he seemed in awe of killer so far that s only a rumor and abc has banned spending money on interviews so i doubt this is true i ve reached my limit of bullshit from mcculloch last night amp govjaynixon today won t b watching dw interview blacks are killing blacks 100x as often as whites are who is destroying black s lives your hate is misguided you re joking i won t watch it i hope this isn t true it was reported on cnn brian i won t be watching that garbage it s a parody account of a character from the hbo show the newsroom oh son of a bitch i cant wait for another crowd fund to go up for him i have some cash i want to send his way killing is proving to be a excellent career move for that p ssy 500k to rub our noses in this in justice what s the source i saw that earlier but just from a right wing crackpot so didn t know what to believe omg shut up sweet deray you re just so damn dumb you were one of those affirmative action hires weren t you sigh really don t they have a policy of not paying for interviews this couldn t b official what about the defense fund people donated to for wilson which exceeded 500k this is so disgusting bastard will have more now than he ever would ve as the popo damn shame what the actual unmitigated fuck that action also shows how corrupt the major news organizations are paying for a murderer s version of his crime are you serious smdh so does race baiting not just abc he shopped himself round to several of the big failstream media wankers ovr the wkend almost like he knew it was time between that and donations he s a fucking millionaire and conservatives don t understand why there s anger screw abc that s disturbing i hope people don t watch this bull no ratings for abc source the only one who can destroy your life is yourself get up and do something and stop complaining that goes for anyone if that s true boycott all abc shows if a fund is set up to support the browns in a civil suit against wilson ferguson pd then it would raise millions of dollars there is a way to make them feel our pain it is called boycott yea and some jerk wants to invite him to the wh to let him know we appreciate him you nitwits amped this non story up to ludicrous levels strategy gt emotions actually it was 513k and they had to sign notarized agreements promising not to give his location to anyone if he retracted they why did you need to mention his tweet at all we need to boycott this might seem like a strange question by where does officer wilson expect to work if they paid him 1 it was too much i didn t watch it he will continue on his media tour as long as it remains profitable he s no good for anything else never was this country is literally built on amp thru the destruction of black lives that it continues is saddening maddening amp unsurprising he is now a success to the klan and the man he married y all i just read that abc paid darren wilson 500k for the interview shame on you fwiw is a parody account for a character on hbo s the newsroom have no idea what their agenda is here i bet the browns did every one of their interviews absolutely free didn t they read it on the internet if so it must be true i bet not did u listen he s telling truth u just don t want to hear it wilson will be on channel 7 8 tonight wonder what he ll get for that one no matter i wont be watching just ask zimmerman 1st its interviews for pay then the gun show circuit for autographs for pay add abc to my boycott list along with walmart olive garden fox pukes err news koch industrie monsanto arggh white men get paid whether they do good or bad white supremacy rule no 1 they ran out of animals now they hunt us not black but i believe it is wrong for him to get paid for this wrong for abc to offer how can anyone do this sorry 4 all false it didn t even come from a reliable source and he wound up with the same amount in donations sickening check that abc doesn t pay for interviews beyond hotel and transportation what got a link where on abc if that s true he got a paid vacation and a million dollar bonus are you serious something in my mind is saying that that is illegal in itself aka fortune hunters vs infamy again who says a black man s life is worthless ka ching opportunity for black friday add bonanza on abc he s gonna need that for the civil suit source is this just networking smearing ea other if real shows being killer cop pays like crime well when he sues the nyt sharpton and the rest i hope he bankrupts them all is it confirmed really i read they didn t pay him anything boycott abc as well just a black person whatever happened to not being able to profit from your crime what wilson s dfenc hinges on i was afraid for my life but he sd in intv that he was worried legally liar murderer wow that s so fucked up good time to boycott divest amp sanction never let rest never who s reporting that ,1

what is haseltine talking about this is simply wrong the common cold coronaviruses confer immunity for several months to several years about 2 years on average seems to also completely confuse the concept of herd immunity with just immunity wtf difficult to see this as anything but alarmism and sensationalism we are 7 months into this pandemic with all eyes on this virus and there is still not a single example of sars cov 2 reinfection reported ,0

if you don t like the term herd immunity why did you use it and what is burnout in this context if you d like to share info i d prefer a source over a twitter account so i don t need to try to sift through a bunch of their info to find whatever it was you hoped to share thx it would be cool if that were true or if we even knew it were possible we don t know if or for how long getting the virus gives an individual immunity for there have been people getting the virus twice the science on this is presumed but isn t in yet covid 19 cases threaten our economy and our ability to ensure hospital care to people who need it everyone should wear a mask to protect those around you practice physical distancing stay home if they re sick and wash their hands regularly ,0

what is needed is a serology test but they aren t available yet i can understand symptom testing in some cases but overall i believe it fails because of asymptomatic spread and people like us who may may not have it this month sometime boris johnson just said that testing capacity currently exceeds demand when 65 million people have been stuck at home for two months out of fear that they or someone they meet might have the disease there s your demand sorry to say this but stfu wtf i have had mild symptoms for over a month that i cant get any kind of treatment for because it might be covid but can t get a test what is he on about hey can i support you on that me too odd stuff cough then gone mild neuralgia then gone not loss of smell increased sudden increase in heart rate and short of breath then gone tired plus still mild occasional cough aches etc temperature up not high for 2 days yes mine is similar weird sounding cough but mostly just feeling short of breath its absolutely not a persistent cough just helps relieve the breathing i feel like i have a sinus infection could be covid says the gp so cant prescribe anything and so i go on suffering it hopefully that would be helpful although if i could get the test many others have had atleast if it came back covid negative i could get treatment for the sinus infection ive been bothered by for the last 5 weeks ,0

thread on spread amp testing how does covid 19 spread it spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes close contact which is being closer than 6 feet for more than 10 minutes w a sick individual increases your risk of catching it 1 12 individuals with severe illness from covid 19 may need hospital care which would still be supportive care of symptoms because there is no specific treatment for the disease 5 12 whether you are positive or negative we ask that people stay home for 72 hours after their symptoms end to avoid passing illness to others 6 12 if you test positive for covid 19 you will need to stay home for 7 days after your positive test or for 72 hours after your symptoms end whichever is longer 7 12 this is different from flu which has a specific antiviral medication that can be given if a flu test is positive no specific treatment for covid 19 no different care after a positive test result 8 12 who gets tested how anyone with symptoms can go to a healthcare provider if the provider decides a test is needed they can collect specimens and request a test from the state lab or order one from a commercial lab 9 12 working with a provider is very important a cough and fever can have many causes so seeing a provider will help you get an answer about cause and treatment 10 12 there is no specific treatment for covid 19 so if your symptoms are from some other cause it s important that you re working with a provider who can help you get well 11 12 still have questions follow or visit 12 12 my kid is i am coughing should i ask for testing contact a healthcare provider if you or your child has symptoms such as cough fever or shortness of breath children typically have milder symptoms more like a common cold 2 12 treatment will not change based on a positive covid 19 test positive or negative treatment will be fluids fever reducing medication rest or other supportive care for symptoms 3 12 there is currently no treatment specific to covid 19 so a positive test result only indicates the cause of illness not any type of treatment 4 12 ,0

can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air how does covid 19 spread people can catch covid 19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid 19 coughs or exhales these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick world health organisation is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings ,0

what is threshold for a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty amp huge consequences for long term impact new paper illustrates 1 key aspect that can reduce it substantially spoiler we still don t know value thread human populations are not well mixed amp homogenous so calcs give likely upper bound q so what is herd immunity threshold hit for real pops a usually lower amp it depends on variation among individuals in 3 things 1 contact rates 2 susceptibility 3 infectiousness background if we know reproductive number r0 for pathogen in population herd immunity threshold hit for well mixed homogenous population is simply 1 1 r0 note r0 varies w behavior host traits environment so differs over time amp space 1 if some individuals have few contacts then they are unlikely to be infected lowering hit note variation in contacts can lead to faster early spread 2 if some aren t susceptible to infection that reduces hit 3 if some people don t transmit that also reduces hit positive correlations among these traits if individuals w more contacts are more susceptible and infectious can make for very rapid changes in dynamics sadly not much empirical data on these correlations amp limited data on predictors of variation on susc amp infect however see paper by that is even better b c more general better data than science paper cited above fig shows how variation susc contacts affects hit f for r0 3 so hit 0 66 f 0 94 science paper link above also shows how reasonable variation in contact rates among individuals reduces hit it considers differential mixing among age groups and hypothetical variation among individuals w in each age group having more or fewer contacts the strange part is that it s not clear what source their age mixing data comes from the citation they give is not a published paper it s a link to a page w matlab files it s weird because there are several age mixing datasets out there can probably provide best ones the take home of the science paper is that pops partially structured by age i e not well mixed and w arbitrary differential activity contact rates w in ages can reduce hit for r0 2 5 from 0 6 to 0 43 the conclusion in the abstract is appropriately worded in making it clear that the paper is simply an illustration of a concept not an actual estimate of the most likely value what i find puzzling is that this paper is in science it s a extremely simple modeling exercise with arbitrarily chosen parameter values it isn t as general as paper cited above and it s not clear it has any new empirical data many older papers say same thing paper is much better in providing empirical estimates of heterogeneity amp impacts on hit f based on data colored lines in figure in idealized population early vaccination to hit will prevent outbreak b c rt r0 s n so rt lt 1 however an epidemic will overshoot hit amp infect larger fraction f of pop where f 1 exp f r0 for r0 2 5 reasonable for covid19 in some pops hit 0 6 and f 0 89 these simple calculations amp flu data are what led to make early widely cited rough back of the envelope calculations that 40 70 of pop would get infected without interventions most articles cited the 70 but knew that i d like to see uncertainty around those estimates of heterogeneity amp some are very indirect estimates but range of values is much better than arbitrarily chosen numbers and suggest heterogeneity is substantial but serological data from nyc suggest that either heterogeneity estimate is too large or r0 is much larger or lockdown did nothing to stop outbreak as seroprevalence is already at overhsoot epidemic size f 20 i added horiz dashed line together papers suggest herd immunity thresh is lt 1 1 r0 and epidemic overshoot lt f 1 exp f r0 but by how much is still unknown ugh smartly gave a wide range 40 70 20 60 in later interviews for fraction infected f w out interventions unfortunately uncertainties in variation in contact rates and susceptibility infectiousness will prevent us from ever having precise value for hit for 1 pop amp it will vary among populations as does r0 the take home message is want to get to hit by vaccination not infection are you aware of any natural or experimental data showing significant divergence say gt 10 from the canonical immunity threshold aside from hiv or stis with highly stratified risk groups yes see link at end to interview with that mentions examples that indicate that heterogeneity can be substantial did some work on this in 2007 or so also when i recall correctly a programme targeting just five per cent of the population could reduce the number of infected people to just one per cent of the scenario where no antiviral drugs were available this is likely true for diseases with very strong heterogeneity i e a few important spreaders heterogeneity is thought to be less so for respiratory illnesses but still substantial do we know yet how much immunity someone who has recovered from the virus has how long it lasts not yet sadly without reading the hu mangus differences in some people contracting and spreading unroll please salam please find the unroll here what is threshold for a topic of much discussion due to large uncertainty amp talk to you soon what is this about nerd immunity assumptions about heterogeneity are just that assumptions but there is plenty of convincing evidence that slow down in spread is strongly linked to lockdowns despite high levels of infection thus heterogeneity is likely less than the models predict ,0

would especially draw attention to s comment what is the trigger for reintroducing mitigation efforts grad said as you lift social distancing you can expect a resurgence of cases as susceptible people are available and since we ve not hit herd immunity since we are far from herd immunity they need to emphasize that opening up doesn t need to entail rising cases if you had really good control and have mitigation measures like mask wearing and good tracing it should just decrease the rate cases are dropping this presumption that rising cases and death are inevitable is not helping ,0
are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus no hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019 ncov to protect yourself against the new coronavirus you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites to date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new coronavirus uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation how effective are thermal scanners in detecting people infected with the new coronavirus thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever i e have a higher than normal body temperature because of infection with the new coronavirus however they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever can spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body kill the new coronavirus no spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes i e eyes mouth be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus no vaccines against pneumonia such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b hib vaccine do not provide protection against the new coronavirus the virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019 ncov and who is supporting their efforts although these vaccines are not effective against 2019 ncov vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health can regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus no there is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus there is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold however regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections can eating garlic help prevent infection with the new coronavirus garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties however there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus does the new coronavirus affect older people or are younger people also susceptible people of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus 2019 ncov older people and people with pre existing medical conditions such as asthma diabetes heart disease appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus who advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus no antibiotics do not work against viruses only bacteria the new coronavirus 2019 ncov is a virus and therefore antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment however if you are hospitalized for the 2019 ncov you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co infection is possible are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus to date there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus 2019 ncov however those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials who is helping to accelerate research and development efforts with a range or partners pls don t panic people with fake news because it s not real all facts are in these threads ,0
when can we expect the full results from this survey so we can interpret comprehensive results with proper context or do we just wait for you to selectively release sections to support the most convenient narrative of the day lot s of folks claiming school choice only benefits the wealthy but our survey of albertans would disagree students from all socioeconomic backgrounds attended every choice of education the percentages were pretty consistent as well education choice benefits all this is rhetorical of course because the survey was so inadequately prepared and questions so leading that it was a rigged method to gather the biased responses you wanted there is a wealth of research evidence that shows for example the devastating effects of summer learning loss on children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds having publicly funded charter schools able to innovate and respond to these issues is making things better for kids ,0

i understand that you need to give boilerplate health advice but my point is if the results of tests are taking a week how useful is that for someone who is asymptomatic who is not able to isolate to wait for the results when can we expect testing with a faster turnaround re cha free covid testing if one is non symptomatic and it takes 5 days after a covid test to find out the results how useful is that delayed test result to prevent that person from spreading the virus my goal before doing a week of vacation and visiting a few people at the end of july is to get tested before i go but if i d need to get tested 5 8 days before leaving is this even a useful exercise if the people you are visiting are vulnerable it would be good to get a negative test and then isolate until you see them residents tested at a mobile site or cha s east cambridge site receive results from these sites are not designed to help residents make real time decisions about visits or vacations they are mainly intended for those w symptoms or who think they were exposed calls residents within 1 2 days of receiving the test result if people do not answer the phone or return the call that day it takes longer to reach them to find out the status of test results leave a message at 617 665 3848 amp you will receive a callback ,0

first what is a coronavirus ulmer this particular strain started in wuhan province it traveled from animals to humans she said people often are first tested for the flu and strep throat so those conditions can be ruled out first panelists beaumont public health director sherry ulmer beaumont emergency management coordinator tim ocnashek bisd assistant superintendent of elementary education anita frank from beaumont psychiatric clinic jason mensah ulmer adds there have been no confirmed cases in beaumont or jefferson county she said she doesn t want to downplay the flu with both viruses the biggest concern is for older people and people whose immune systems are compromised we re fortunate we have a vaccine for the flu if we re familiar with it it s less scary to us she notes because covid 19 is so new there s little knowledge about what it will do and at this time no vaccine ulmer says she doesn t know how many cases are in texas but mensah says there are 51 ulmer said she knows 80 percent of people who get coronavirus will just get essentially the common cold i m trying to get more info on this stat she s quoting i know thanks to i think that the study that showed 80 percent of people get mild symptoms included pneumonia so mild is relative here ulmer said she s hearing anywhere between one and two years for the timeline to develop a vaccine she says that s why it s important to continue tried and true healthcare methods wash your hands stay home when you re sick clean services with antibacterial and antiviral sprays lysol clorox and 409 are cdc approved to kill the virus we understand that the virus can last on surfaces for up to three hours feldschau asks how coronavirus is spread he gives some facts he s heard and asks the panel to separate fact and fiction he s been told it spreads through coughing and sneezing lives several hours airborne and three days on hard surfaces and a person is contagious for 37 days ulmer reiterates that the virus lasts for three hours on hard surfaces the virus is transmitted person to person she says that can include being in close quarters with someone simply talking to them because you can breath in the droplets that s why six feet is the recommendation when doing social distancing ulmer said the health department is putting together soemthing so people know what the next step is if jefferson county has a confirmed case i m going to use tim s first name because his last name is hard to keep spelling so tim says the city wants to reduce the spread by taking preemptive measures that includes limiting crowds increasing the outreach and the encouragement of people to take precautionary 1 2 measures i would like to add as of friday the city had not cancelled any events that would limit crowds the comment was at this time danger is not high enough that that consideration needed to be taken 2 2 tim says we re not trying to scare people there s a lot of bad information out there he encourages people to get information only from reputable sources instead of looking at things on facebook or from friends and spreading it like it s a fact we would encourage people to be patient because it s a fluid situation feldshau he notes that people questioned having a live audience when the panel was announced earlier this week however when advice was given to keep events small the church went to live streaming ulmer says the city nine years ago developed a pandemic plan and several times a year the city gets together to talk about the plans and practice them we are as prepared as we can be with the information we re getting of course it s fluid but we re accustomed to these types of situations reiterating a point made previous people most at risk are those 65 and older and those with preexisting conditions she said children diagnosed with coronavirus 19 years and under are doing very well for our children it sounds like god has smiled on us now talking about flattening the curve people are trying to take protective measures to flatten the peak of infections this is not here today and gone tomorrow feldschau ulmer said allowing the infections to peak so high would tax our healthcare system should the city county get there it would have to look at alternative ways to treat people she didn t expand on what those alternatives are she said that s one reason why people should call their doctor or emergency rooms before just showing up i we know that you re coming the staff can be ready for you they can meet you outside they can give you a mask that s one way now we re trying to alleviate the workload on the healthcare system is to try to plan 1 2 as best we can that people are going to be expected to coming in with complaints of difficulty breathing and thoughts of coronavirus 2 2 feldshau says the state of emergency is not for where we are now but as a precaution to avoid losing control in the future if we ever lose control we re going to have a serious problem from comment section on the video if this virus is just like the flu amp spreads like viruses do airborne i m not understanding the panic amp closure of so many things what is it about this virus that we would want to close schools churches etc but we don t do it for flu this seems to be one of the most liked and loved comments someone simply responded yassss and another said people don t know what to do so they just shut everything down i guess so even on a live stream intended to give people information and was very clear on why precautions are being taken ,0

so what is your argument by the data i believe this virus is overblown and not much worse statistically than the flu we have prevented herd immunity with quarantines cost millions their jobs and livelihoods and killed thousands of elderly due to bad governors oh really trump did everything the experts advised too much imo what happened to states rights this was a nyc and ny nj state failure that is where half of the deaths are from 2 million cases is much less than seasonal flu cases with a vaccine herd immunity is not sure say it is there you would have clogged the hc system with the sick as happened in italy and is happening now in sweden which tried that approach and now recognize it wasn t the right one ,0
how does covid 19 spread a we are learning more and more about how covid 19 spreads evidence originally was very strong that it was present in the droplets of people who were infected when those people cough or sneeze the virus can be transmitted to others who breathe in the virus or if their hands become contaminated with the virus and then they touch their face there is more evidence that the virus lives on surfaces for long enough periods of time to be transmitted up to several days later people who have no symptoms are also able to spread the virus this is part of the reason it is very hard to contain and slow the spread of covid 19 without taking the current measures of social distancing ,0

okay i have to ask how does covid 19 spread without someone having symptoms i don t understand where does it come from then hi chelsea an individual can carry the virus and be without symptoms for several days some carriers won t get sick at all but the virus is still in their system if they cough or sneeze without covering their mouths or cover their mouths without washing hands after gt and then touch you or a door knob or gas pump or bag of chips that you then touch it is transmitted here s the cdc site that talks about it in a bit more detail the good news is that they feel the non symptomatic spread isn t as prevalent gt ugh that s scary people dealing with that stuff need to be good with washing their hands i made a post on fb about the different ways our body s react to pathogens i ll tag you i understand that but you still have to sneeze or cough for the virus to get onto a surface so yes you can be a carrier and not actually be sick but you still need a way for the virus to come out of you and onto surfaces ,0

the results of any antibody serology tests the cdc has conducted and a full breakdown of the real fatality rate stratified for each cohort of age gender race and health status if they don t have this data then what is the purpose of throwing tens of billions at them how many nursing home residents died as distinct from those who died among the general population along with a state by state breakdown how many deaths occurred on the day they were recorded vs how many were backfilled how many of the nursing home deaths are confirmed as having died as a result of the virus as opposed to just having tested positive like tens of millions of americans who likely had the virus but didn t get a severe case how many coronavirus patients were admitted straight from hospitals to nursing homes broken down by state a definitive national and state by state number of how many of the 72 000 deaths were in long term senior care facilities if we cant get this simple data published by the administration why even give another penny why do we have to rely on private studies ,0

similarity adolph wasn t a rapist donald trump is put him in a time machine and post him back to the bunker with hitler if air force one s a rockin don t come a knockin subtweet for everybody else well hitler did make germany great again just saying ay dios mio guess you don t know anything about what s happening in america let alone the world bye do not insult the guinea pig hinald trumpton perhaps the has alot in common with nazis mb in and now be careful what you wish4 speechless lolwat us fucktards wouldn t worry if the consequences of bullshit american politics were restricted to america no what s the flop in the original quick let s build a wall to keep the hairpieces out at least the hair would be real god that s scary hitler also confiscated people s guns sounds a lot like what our president is trying to do stop he is right i hate these stupid ridiculous comparisons he is no where near hitler hitler embarked upon a campaign of extermination hillary hold your nose and vote donald vote and hold your breath lol i agree on trump s anti muslim stance looking sexy 50 lad hahahahahahaaha kmcrh that shit gonna be stopped at the wall fuckin truffula trees sounds like we shall overbomb smart but financially weak people can t contest elections so stupid billionaires rule the world made me think invasion of the bodysnachers haha lol volle zustimmung lol lol classic back at trumps ranch the donkey handed round the kleenex hahahahahaha this is too cute sieht täuschend echt nach trumps frisur aus wobei seine frisur das schönste an ihm ist was etwas heißen will no stash on the lip 12 million victims of which 6 millions were jews there always hv bn fringe elements in every society ignoreable but islamic terrr nt ignoreable protected amp promotd by world msm you live in the us model of ulgham very good comparison i m not a crook excuse me for a moment checker s quit humping my leg now where was i yea mind your business canada eh yea they are identical idiot lmao lmao this book may enlighten you bird amp bird brain together again rt adolf hitler vs donald trump i m just seeing john cena breaking news john cena is a nazi and is gullible so he finally admits he is an immigrant too but he doesn t get it idiot legit had to just look in my philosophy book to remind myself what the teleological argument was maybe she ll vote 4 bernie he s way better than trump he actually knows wtf he s doing unlike trumps sorry ass i found his hair growing on the roadside trumpus clumpus heil trump beware of haters adolf hitler vs donald trump jeetje sir how dare you defame the memory of my late brother in queerness al lewis grandpa munster by comparing vile ted cruz to him block for agree wholeheartedly awesome voting for the lesser of two evils has left the people dissatisfied its a damn scary thing blödsinn clinton cash get the book haha throw ted cruz in their too that guy is a psycho bahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa deep stuff there can t disagree with the first 3 but the last 3 for trump is bit of a stretch especially last one the nazis were socialists you have the wrong party actually trump has extra pro not a killer done right bahahahaha way to similar but followers are like 1930 s germany and they ridicule you if you disagree sound familiar omg yes trump boy schultz there s an even greater resemblance just below the tail trump may trigger third world war then jews were not blowing themselves up or scheming to kill germans this is false analogy or a joke at best well hilarious love it oh not only is it fair it needs some special attention before it comes to pass to many had to die trying to stop it before feel the bern should so be his entire campaign we can user this as an example for the teleological argument why compare them it wont sway trump voters they love their similarities one of first things president trump will do in 2017 is procecute crooked hillary lol since hitler won the office the natural corollary is that donald drumph will too he also spoke in complete sentences comprised of words with more than two syllables see ya also has bad hair days on a regular basis most of what is spoken on the media about is fake oh no trump is a new name of supreme god be carreful lol loool ewwwwww liz as the president would say you re a jack ass it s unfortunately a fake picture i just don t know what internment camp i have to report to when trump takes over my back is gonna hurt from bldg the wall too bahahaha yes its heartwarming that they still spend their lives trying to make things better for the rest of us when it costs them so dear hitler was elected as head of government u right you mean women like the terrorist don t support hitler amp trump politics but like to say jews are not what muslims are there are a lot of differences the purpose of software engineering is to control complexity not to create it zave america is america with the immigrants that started it the country belonged to the native indians took their land and made it usa on to a winner then but timing is off as the recession is over lol yup quite a few too but hitler fooled people and get elected by millions that like him and vote for him while trump eh oh my god lol i tried not to really he s a scary guy tratan de desprestigiarlo por ser el mas opcionado how many days is this love good for amazing had one on my wheel it was huge its all about him me me me what i say is right everyone else is wrong but hitler was a leftist socialist what s wrong why are you so worried even saudis think in the same way trump s an utter wanker luckly in the us he can fool only the gop faithful i hope can win over hillary easily and he is a better candidate suuport him have we listened to our politicians they use immigration x to get to power whipping up hatred to mask their incompetence jajajajajajaja reminds me of the beauty and the beast amp veterans live in ac rooms that s all so true rofl or does his hair look like the caterpillar get a spring in your step with the trumpalin the thing you got wrong was the title it s not trump v hitler it s trump amp hitler im no bleeding heart liberal but hate breeds hate omfg and both made distinctive but terrible hair choices i feel like south park did an episode addressing this very issue these shoes are by gucci and retail over 2000 i think they look like donald trump s hair gruesome ट रम प न गलत परम पर श र करक अम र क र ष ट रपत क च न व क भ रत क च न व स भ ग द बन द य if hitler had won paeans would have been sung for him it s winner takes all aren t they wild free range tribbles now imagine any other country where a person with similar characteristics like trump is that close to become president by now nature of twitter very much a global deal you don t like what ppl say block them easy as that patética comparación rara en una persona tan aguda como el sr lucien no tiene ni pies ni cabeza trump is an entertainment personality that exercises his freedom to say whatever he wants hitler murdered millions lol donolf hump wow we ve a new low when germany is calling us fascist done your point is what first you must be a liberal to have that comparison and second you must be a liberal or a rino gt do you happen to know this veterans name i like rump too what a load of bollocks hillary trump looks like voldemort from the first harry potter movie imo trump s personality is closer to mussolini s everyone is too stupid to realize the difference they make up whatever bullshit they want to racial homogenization better for usa abound the now replace donald trump with narendra modi what a truly cynical butt facetrump is his butt facedness is so great it threatens to pull earth from it s gravitational rotation the donald as blob fish just saying but remember hitlet finally came to power they totally do hard to choose this guy scares the hell out of me 8 million people would beg to differ with you have you ever been to a holocaust museum he looks like a common bird i guess r k laxman is still working in heaven uncle thinks trump should retire and become an uncle d but it s obviously a wave either to someone specific or the crowd in that direction j aime he she looks better now there is actually a whole mountain of trump s hair in mexico i guess this is where he source it ,1

reagan 11 mass shootings bush sr 12 mass shootings clinton 23 mass shootings bush jr 16 mass shootings obama 162 mass shootings source wonder what the makeup of congress looked like with sticker gun laws and 123 shooting i wonder why protect 2nd amend correlation is causation terror will continue to reign as long as good men do nothing obama has to be a plant to destroy america did they change the definition of mass shootings i m sure this will be labeled workplace violence i d love a source on that also wasn t the awb during clinton and bush2 are you trying to say it s reagan s fault his legacy will be alot of blood shed at home i am sure the hateful divisive us vs them rhetoric from wasn t a factor sarc off obama hate race religion gender himself just like the stock market does better with dem president fact this is merely coincidental alleen de laatste doet er iets aan dat is verschil en media duikt op alles what is the appropriate response to sabotage lol well maduro fidel obama has encouraged mass shootings by politicizing them also by being useless defending against terrorism if that is true that is a crazy statistic 162 of these were work related violence enter in causalties of war may even the playing field this happens when congress blocks rational gun control mass shootings boost gun sales amp lobbyists the entitlement of the right have their beliefs and position questioned and they lose their shit all a bunch of bs 162 most of which were in gun free zones the establishment of no gun zones created this disaster maybe they aren t totally accurate but we weren t having these kinds of convos pre 2008z links to democrats and a islam are rampant see the pattern dems drive people to madness killers they are because that evil sick funk muslim potus likes it hope they can kill as many people as possible by doing a quick magazine change its hard not to give excuses to anyone but social cohesion must be part of it obama divides nice visual he s a muslim and yet liberals continue to support our dick tator in chief this is not coincidental but orchestrated correlation causation how about the numbers in the workforce breakdown too ovamit s climate change disarm america and let the terrorists rain bullets and bombs thank you for this i was going to look this up i knew it was much higher but had no idea it was this high it s still all the fault of pres bush out of curiosity what s the source of those numbers wow what variables are you comparing statistics are pointless without meaning p value less than 05 i believe there s a significant difference the common denominator is obama when it comes to death in america when he is gone we can begin to rebuild usa so it s obama s fault people are insane very interesting a breakdown by race might explain some things i m thinking poor real economy colliding with entitled kids social media an abundance of a holes why the increase under o o amp his injustice dept will not pursue death penalty for punishment of criminals what analysis cause there wasn t much social media like there is today global warming has gotten worse i m sure that s why obama s number is so high right what would they do if we said we want to keep our guns to combat and the madness it s creating do not be deceived there are 2 possible motives 1 gun control 2 police state obama is bad omen a pertinent comment on the increased violence under an islamic inclined president by the numbers islamist muslims kill obama faith deadlier then obama what s your point not surprising those presidents had a gun control act which was struck down in 2008 no cultural rot amp o works to disarm law abiding citizens while making others soft targets hey i m starting to see a trend there with those numbers can you spell democrap according to liberal math there s been 352 this year so it s even worse if you add murdered feelings more than an omen he is a puppet of evil pure n simple step it up ronald oops the relevant number gun homicides annually dropping steadily ok but what are the golf handicaps of each president only stats this idiot is interested in i m waiting to hear pres obama spin the mass shooting stats on his watch as caused by almost all after changes in expanded definition and increase in more restrictive laws thanks libs i ll keep mine thanks boy this info is enlightening the most divisive president in us history has quite a legacy with this stat is there a democrat problem go back to your safe zone we ll take care of everything as usual seriously we have three guns and i don t ammo is expensive wow it s interesting how global warming has driven islamic terrorists in america amp our president mad right on plan to destabilize the nation interesting since reagans time the numbers have unfortunately increase why channa when you call the police do you tell them to not bring their guns don t be a hypocrite not over yet still counting impenetrable lawgic this isnt evidence it s correlation that s a pretty crazy sad stat reagan should have attempted assassination hope and change political based accidental planned makes me wanna go buy another 20 guns w ammo look like a cannon coming never let a crisis go to waste lol so what are you saying if mccain romney were president the number would be much less link to the source of these stats wow the mass killer prez for sure there s b0 s legacy ,1

sunday psa please read and share what is herd immunity in ontario for covid based on calculations about 2 1 with only 1 in 11 cases of covid detected only 2 1 of population has had exposure no herd immunity and must be careful perhaps you think these calculations are theoretical and don t matter but they align very well with what swiss researchers have found 11 6 cases for every 1 case detected most of the population of geneva remains unexposed despite large case number please wash your hands wear masks keep as far away from others and limit interactions all these actions will help to keep you your family your neighbours and our healthcare system healthy so children are usually considered vectors of disease and everyone believes that kids spread germs but is this true for covid could it be that kids are not the superspreaders we think they are summary work from irish health technology group here and a link to the report they have published here what s going on with younger kids are they breathing less volume on people yes they are smaller talk less forcefully do they have less prolonged interaction with others compared to older kids or is there something fundamentally different in their immune response well it looks like policies aimed at kids may have a lesser impact on transmission of coronavirus infections implications for school openings sick kids hospital in agreement kids are not the super spreaders ,0

under the how long is the incubation period for covid 19 section you do realise that it takes at least 2 3 weeks for any measures to make a difference right ok another twitter expert it seems have a word with the cmo he ll probably be well pleased with your input aren t you the twitter expert you clearly think that you know better than the science supporting the action of governments globally no i observed that the measures italy have put in place havent seemed to have made a difference i haven t made any statements about how long measures take you have ok well you should probably read this then you may learn why they are having such issues in italy that s virtually the same advice on the gov website it s just a q amp a it doesn t explain why italy are having issues as i said incubation period is 1 14 days italy has been locked down since the 9th march 13 days there will be cases coming in since before that people won t be in hospital from day 1 of symptoms time delay is the killer here by the time it s visibly bad it will be too late ah ok and where can i find all that information on the link you gave me right ok so if the measures in italy are successful then the death rate should be falling drastically over the next 2 days hopefully although you would also need to know how long people are showing symptoms before they die point is we can t wait and need to try everything we can to stop the spread otherwise the nhs will be on its knees italy has more hospital beds per capita than us ,0

brain teaser assume that 5 of the population has antibodies and the serology test has a 95 accuracy specificity sensitivity 0 95 what is the probability p that i have antibodies if i test positive for bonus points explain your answer in comments not needed to respond the teaser hence the answer is the tricky d which i did not get because i wasn t watching for strict inequalities and thought i was picking greater than or equal to 50 but less than 95 0 5 if you are a frequentist if you are an hypochondriac bayesian and you work in an hospital with covid 19 patients i e p antibodies gt 0 05 then the probability shifts towards 1 if you apply bayes you get the same result of course things change if you change the prior but that is unrelated to frequentist vs bayesian hint thomas bayes would be of great help strict inequalities prior and likelihood neutralize each other exactly p covid y 0 05 p test y 0 095 p test y covid y 0 95 p covid y test y p test y covid y p covid y p test y 0 95 0 05 0 095 0 5 i m taking my chance and not reading the other replies beforehand it s 50 50 we have two random binary variables tst good test and atb antibodies present plus one observable res ult given same specificity and sensitivity we can assume both vars are independent thus among four possible combinations of tst x atb we have two that lead to res positive i e tst and atb or not tst and not atb p tst atb p not tst not atb 0 0475 so 50 50 between these two possibilities 50 400 person trial 20 are positive 380 negative 361 380 of the negative test negative 19 20 of the positive test positive but 19 380 negative test positive any positive test is 50 50 a true positive or false negative if i test positive i am either a fp or a tp the number of fps is the number of negatives 95 of pop x the chance of misclassifying them 5 the number of tps is the number of positives 5 of the pop x the chance of correctly classifying them 95 hence p 0 5 cheeky answer categories i m always entertained by how similar bayes theorem and base rate neglect have similar names and are related to each other 50 one of my first go to questions while interviewing data science candidates true positives tp 95 5 false positives fp 05 95 tp p tp tp fp 50 but here is the issue i can say i have a magical prediction power simply i predict a negative result for everybody and i win over the lab test but i have zero sensitivity none of the above it is 50 50 could use bayes but ppl don t understand that so do example suppose 10k ppl tested at 5 incidence 500 have antibodies 9500 don t 95 500 475 true positives 0 05 9500 475 false negatives fn tp so you have no idea which of the two sets you are in so 0 5 ,0

gotten flu shot and pneumonia shot as well maybe next time thanks now you made the diabetic want some frosting i found it unsettling that while talking to dr lapook you took another alcohol drink in the middle of his explanation of potential life saving drugs this was disrespectful and inappropriate do you have some drinking problem where you must drink while broadcasting your show fever dry cough a whole pint container as long as it s the whipped kind nutella instead ask him why i am starting to resemble my sourdough starter great show tonight great guest thank you some body said we have to wash our hands for 15 minutes is it right youtube not showing notifications for ur videos i m just going to assume the answer to the frosting one is three or four tubs thank you if you eat the frosting while standing it is exercise trembling with fear burns calories you lifted me up today be safe im trying to stay alive tuesday night was hilarious your team is doing great job producing an entertaining show on the fly sort of like replacing an airplane engine in flight i miss the live audience a craving sweets b the whole thing you re welcome why was dr lapook evasive in so many of his answers example when can we hug again answer hugging is good for you if viewers want evasion we get that with trump s press conferences how about a good honest i don t know unless this was satire it was highlight of my week i shave on wednesdays what s your highlight bothered me he said the drug trump was pushing like a dealer with no scientific proof and condemned by the ama this dr said was part of the standard protocol in treating patients maybe this is a new york thing i as a patient would like the right to refuse it very good questions about covid19 thank you for bringing drlapook to your program i am getting tired of cooking but i have been afraid of ordering now i feel a little more confident about deliveries in a graham cracker i would like to say as much as it takes and don t forget the tall glass of milk you should interview john krasinski he has this amazing show called some good news and i think he would be a great person to interview thanks for doing your show i hope you can feel our laughter across the airwaves i was able to watch sam hunt and dave matthews in my chair g i jon has done so well that i couldn t think of anything to ask him he couldn t be betta i have a question for dr lapook why are they serving the trump cocktail to covoid patients at his hospital can t wait to hear about the frosting thing it s for a friend i am on plaquenil for ra am i immune you might ask the doc how to fix this dr my husband snores can i get the corona virus if he breathes on me thank you from for letting the world know how is the worst in history keep up your good work stephen as much homemade buttercream frosting you can stomach before vomiting x nay on canned symptoms many cough fever body aches out of breath or none of the above cannot really know without a test everyone needs to be tested dear doctor would it make stephen and some first responders happier if he would invite them to zoom skype in to be his audience he could hear their responses and they would get a sweet preview of the show win win great interview you may find this interesting more importantly what was looking at up and to his right over and over during that interview a clock another samurai sword espn highlights of the 11 10 99 game vs the rockets where he and barkley got ejected would love to see john and the band do a song on zoom miss seeing the whole band stephen thank you for the laughs each night you are one of the few bright lights these days enjoying a late show really like the home show and can hear and enjoy the musicians so much better cbs is doing a great job to keep this all going forward these are important things to find out on your show you ve mentioned you miss the audience would it help at all if your viewers recorded their reactions sent them in were complied together in 1 file then played over the show taping i mean i know it wouldn t help during recording since it s not live but at least you d know how people reacted maybe i can confirm from personal testing the answer to the second question is more than 1 jar aaand now i want to instacart a frosting after just a few weeks our skies are clearer and the water is cleaner maybe we could plan to return to a different and better normal and there are dolphins swimming in the canals in venice that one really impressed me and i saw the pictures watching you change

permanent expression on your face as if though you soiled yourself i don t appreciate seeing you denigrate obama endorsing biden in one of your skits tonight i used to think that you were funny how much goy blood can a vampire ingest before getting sick no one has talked about building the immune system with what you eat and taking supplements this can help mitigate the symptoms is to build a strong immune system all i hear is drugs and vaccine guess there is no money in foods and supplements whos a bigger pedophile stephen colbert or steven spielberg making fun of just one person all the

really helpful people are wearing n99 masks for safety these days what about protection against influenza abd measles we already have protections for both of those a hibernate like a bear until this passes i ve an urgent question due to the answer to one of the questions about the ways of protection against covid_19 a big misunderstanding occured about using or not using vitamin c since the answer including the things which may be harmful like alcohol smoking and herbal tea and taking vitamin c got viral in iran i wanted you to clarify the answer again is vitamin c useful to increase the quality of immune system or it is harmful in this case of covid_19 thanks for sharing in iran we need the urgent intervention of the world health organization to prevent disaster this government has no crisis management at all i am absolutely appalled by the lack of measures put in place at train stations and airports across europe strict checks should be in place at every large city for both departures and arrivals in order to mitigate the risk of virus carriers spreading the disease i travelled from london to milan and paris to london the last few days milan only arrival passengers are being monitored for the disease while paris gare du nord has no measures in place whatsoever what is being done to fight this global pandemic the image is to small to read declare a pandemic face mask hand washing and less social activity a do not believe a single word from and stop wasting time declare a pandemic before this gets out of hand reinfection has already been confirmed worse the cause is unknown the virus can persist in the body even after being cured in the lesions of the organs and reactivate when immunity decreases first don t trust wuhan health organization it s very likely that that covid 19 becomes iran needs immediate help and support healthcare providers are suffering from huge shortage of masks and proper infection prevention materials a disaster is happening in iran please start a campaign to help them at least by providing n95 masks when are we declaring pandemic lost our nerve i might be crazy but declaring it a pandemic might help but what do i know no

2021 7 7 billion people may become infected 432 million people can die from the virus this kind of virus is dangerous for china people only because it was made by human beings against other human beings what do you mean by not having a process to declare pandemic its an essence of your job to inform about diseases so what the hell what happened to your daily media conference the virus can be transferred thru droplets it can be transmitted through aerosols if you re in the same room as some1 amp they are breathing the same air you can get the virus masks amp eyewear are key it can be transmitted through urine amp faeces don t use public toilets the only advice for the world is don t trust who and learn from hkprotesters and taiwan don t believe any news from ccp hkg and who hk have exp from sars which also infect by china and ccp lie on the history and pretend they are savior don t let them play this trick again its a pandemic announce it as such for the sake of god you

chinese and listen to thomas he knows how about who you do the right thing and declare a pandemic now stop sharing ways to protect the virus find the vaccine just take action now for god sake otherwise this thing is gonna kill the human race for good is that it i cannot believe you want more money to keep telling us that you say that the window for containing the virus is closing but you

anymore first change director tedrosold liar god you guys are useless a closed china s borders earlier u can wash your hands as much as you want but evidence indicates to the virus being transferable

occupies several seats within this omt what is the scientific foundation of the omt advice and what is the reason this herd immunity like strategy was adopted government deems the chosen strategy a success or more specifically that is the message the government tries to convey to the public the government claims to have based their decision on sound scientific advice provided by the omt the dutch centre for disease control rivm technical briefing march 18th an important key in resolving these questions was provided in the parliamentary technical briefing of march 18th 2020 in this briefing omt chairman jaap van dissel presented the following figure 1 that outlined the strategic options that were considered by the omt figure 1 the 3 conceived covid 19 pandemic control strategies the three considered strategic options 1 no interventions a worst case scenario where the virus is allowed to spread freely red 2 maximum control a mitigation scenario where social distancing decelerates the spread green 3 lock down a containment scenario where mandatory isolation diminishes the spread blue had been evaluated using a model for which to date no source code or parameters were made public the lock down scenario is kind of odd it would have been expected that the post maximum slope of this curve would be significantly steeper as compared to no interventions curve surprisingly here the slope is even shallower than the maximum control slope this suggests there is a feedback present which decelerates the spread in the model used to evaluate these strategic options simplified epidemic modelling epidemic models can be conceptualised by a sequence of bins containing persons in different stages of a disease a one way transfer is considered where persons transfer from one bin to the next the rate at which persons transfer is described by a parameter an example is the seir model this model considers four disease stages 1 susceptible persons that are susceptible to the pathogen i e not immune 2 exposed persons that are exposed to the pathogen but or not yet contagious 3 infected persons that can spread the pathogen 4 recovered persons that have recovered i e immune figure 2 seir model containing four disease stages the transfer rates govern how long a person remains in a specific disease stage e g the duration of the infectious period is determined by parameters delta and gamma such a disease model does not directly consider adverse effects a disease may have e g disability to death the previously noted feedback present in the model results presented at the technical briefing suggests there is a parallel route figure 3 within the model used for figure 3 a parallel seir with a severe and asymptomatic route scenario discrimination such a parallel route if it runs via asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons could provide for a path to recovered and therefore immune persons the other route is comprised of symptomatic persons which may require additional care if the symptomatic persons are in their infectious bin for a longer duration as compared to the asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic persons this means that there will be a fast reservoir of immune persons quickly i e a huge dampening effect as the pathway through asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic dominates over symptomatic persons this parallel seir model when applied to the covid 19 data available from wuhan narrow spike would yield the following conclusions about the virus 1 was highly infectious most infected people where not on the radar in wuhan 2 could not easily be contained figure 4 idealised seir tti model unfortunately the parallel seir model is in a sense equivalent to a seir model that allows for track trace isolation tti shown in figure 4 ironically that is what the chinese actually did they aggressively tracked traced and isolated infected and suspected persons this essentially halts transmission the exposed bin is kept nearly empty when the seir tti model is applied to the wuhan data this would yield the following conclusions about the virus 1 was moderately infectious 2 tti was very effective the suspected actual used model is more involved as it is comprised of several age levels e g for each age cohort a more detailed seir tti equation is applied when age separation is considered it may have appeared based on wuhan data that herd immunity could be build relatively cheaply and quickly by keeping younger people at work as the r0 would be hugely overestimated while the severity of the disease was hugely underestimated while vulnerable people kept home a costly mistake as it has turned out for more details and references see in dutch ,0

what is a coronavirus coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans in humans several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as mers sars and now covid 19 what are the symptoms of covid 19 the most common symptoms of covid 19 are fever tiredness and dry cough some patients may have aches and pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually 1 3 some people become infected but don t develop any symptoms and don t feel unwell most people about 80 recover from the disease without needing special treatment around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing 2 3 older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness people with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention 3 3 how does covid 19 spread people can catch covid 19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid 19 coughs or exhales 1 3 these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth 2 3 people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick 3 3 can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low 1 2 however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill 2 2 ,0

so another important data point to review each day is the percent positive of all patients tested by pcr and serology test types what is percent positive out of the total number of missourians tested it is the percentage that have had a positive test result for june 1 that percentage was 6 5 for pcr tests and 4 for serology tests you can also find a table showing how many tests were done each day in missouri and how many of those were positive if you view that table you will note that the number of positive tests daily has remained relatively stable while the total number of tests daily has increased that means the percentage of missourians being diagnosed with covid 19 is lowering to view this information to help understand the full picture visit and select covd 19 dashboard if you are viewing on a mobile device select mobile site in the yellow box at the top left for improved accessibility of the information or you can click on the circle in the top left of each individual box to view the information full screen for best viewing use a desktop or laptop ,0

that s what i dont understand if nyc is saying 25 of people have had it or whatever what is stopping the other 75 getting it or at least 35 before you get herd immunity amp dying at a rate of c0 7 there is zero logic to it unless you believe the serology number is wrong fyi those engaging with my tweet re nz i am very convinced by prof michael levitt s logic in this interview it s a must watch key takeaways covid infections are never exponential and infection rates start to slow quite quickly after a proportion of the population become infected this suggests very strongly that immunity is being conferred mmm feels like he is betting the farm on the fact there will be no second wave if he s wrong it s absolutely horrible well the pattern of each local epidemic since the first 2 in china on to south korea iran and italy have all been very similar i think it s very safe to assume that a population which has had that level of exposure of a london or new york won t have a second wave nothing did you listen to the whole interview the slightly unpalatable truth is that there is a minimum level of infection and death needed to confer immunity in a population he quantifies it as 4 weeks of excess deaths here he was on march 30 telling us new york had turned the corner ,0

the law if so do you understand what that means it doesn t mean that everything the government does has to make everyone feel any certain way it means that laws must be applied equally to all people which law is being applied unequally as a result of the existence of these unless it s a majority they can keep talking put it to a referendum if the voters of a particular area want it taken down they can say so otherwise it should stay the government should never allow the destruction by the mob of public or private property you appear to be conflating removal of statues by government action and by mob as you put it this thread deals solely with the former equality under the law is not subject to a vote by the majority i suspect you agree when it comes to the governmental taking of private property restriction of gun rights and whatever constitutional right floats your boat using pro slavery monuments to continue to intimidate or otherwise send a message to african americans should not be permitted merely because a majority wishes to do so i thought this was about the mob as that s what matt said in his tweet anyway it s a real stretch to say that something i m against being left in place causes me to be unequal do you know that the equality mentioned in our founding documents refers to equal treatment under statues ,0

possibly but one has to ask oneself what is different now from before the virus is no different large scale surveys tell us that not all that many in eg spain have had it 7 so herd immunity very unlikely maybe private social distancing is enough climate unlikely this article intrigued me so unless i have missed reading something important the early release of lockdown is precisely what is going to put us into the worst of both worlds on the assumption that regulated social distancing has added to the economic cost paid up front in that what we saw would not have happened with purely private social distancing if we release now without enough test trace isolate sorry very boring to continue to repeat then we ll have created a gt recession than needed for little gain as we go back to a let the virus rip strategy what gain there will have been will have been purely about trimming the top off the curve ie reducing peak case load and reducing mortality from lack of care seems like a second wave is modestly unlikely europe has returned without it some us states have seen second wave but really this is just first wave not properly reduced major unknown factor for me in this is prior immunity from previous coronavirus exposure i can t make the evidence and theory fit otherwise and proper epidemiologists like don t rule this out what have you read on that last point ,0

contact tracing fail herd immunity fail ppe fail testing fail lockdown fail care homes fail contact tracing again fail this government has presided over a serious of failures so catastrophic that it should trigger an overhaul of how things are run in this country why 60000 dead you okay with that herd immunity has nothing to do with genetics other than the fact that viruses can rapidly evolve and make it it not happen it is entirely possible to be a tory shiver and see how this government has absolutely failed the british public is your bar that low or are you blinded by devotion to get brexit done schtick demand better ffs have higher standards for yourself and great britain ,0
what is the appropriate case fatality rate then 1 4 is reasonable what percentage do you think is required for herd immunity even at 70 the number dead is too high to contemplate w o a vaccine 3 2340 000 herd immunity will arrive long before a vaccine that would require 70 80 of the population to be exposed and our healthcare infrastructure is certainly not prepared to deal with the consequences of that and i doubt most of us are ready for the rate of death that would accompany that rate of exposure 3 7 million dead assuming a 1 4 death rate and 80 of us population exposed 330 million x 80 x 1 4 exposure is my math right 1 4 is wrong furthermore you will not need an 80 percent infection rate to achieve this what is the appropriate case fatality rate then 1 4 is reasonable doubtful because the true denominator is completely unknown also cell immunity appears to play a large role completely undetected through current testing you just say stuff but you don t read the source i supplied nor supply any of your own and to obtain cell immunity you have to have had the virus already that s what the 70 80 of people exposed get cell immunity one hopes ,0

can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air let s help fight the spread of the coronavirus let s protect ourselves our loved ones colleagues friends the community and our country so here s a thread of q amp a on coronaviruses covid 19 from world health organization some people become infected but don t develop any symptoms and don t feel unwell most people about 80 recover from the disease without needing special treatment around 1 out of every 6 people who gets covid 19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing 2 3 older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness people with fever cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention 3 3 how does covid 19 spread people can catch covid 19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid 19 coughs or exhales 1 3 these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth 2 3 people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick 3 3 can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low 1 2 however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill 2 2 ,0

the death recorded in kano alone is on the high side governors from that region should declare total lockdown to prevent the spread but this is nigeria where governors always see issues like this as an avenue to make money if boko haram can become a business what is 19 has any official statement being issued about the deaths they are typing it it will surprise you to know that some state governors that doesn t have a case of corvid 19 are praying fervently to even get 1 case so they can get from corvid 19 funds donations before it gets exhausted states without a case doesn t even av any thing on ground as preparation everything to these people is business as usual look at anambra yesterday relapsing lockdown exactly my point if bh that killed people in the most horrific ways can become an enterprise what is ordinary sickness afterall people have been getting sick and dying from time immemorial sometimes i ask god what was my offence in heaven that made him send me to nigeria locking down kano is the right thing to do kano might well be to nigeria what algeria is to africa algeria death rate 14 3 nigeria 2 9 ghana 0 86 remember this tweet bro you should know the problem of the region is unending they themselves aid and abate uncalled for situations always thinking backward when a reasonable solution should be proffered to alienate and arrest an unwarrantable conditions they shouldn t lockdown then sebi it s food they want to eat they seem to behave as if they got an anti covid 19 lockdown in kano na only we southerners dey obey law bros they are seeing it as a joke until victims starts crossing to neighboring states and it spread beyond control nigbayen lori won a pe hhhhmn i weep for my nation the governor ordered 1000 facemasks yesterday while opened second isolation center same day ,0

can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air how does covid 19 spread people can catch covid 19 from others who have the virus the disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with covid 19 coughs or exhales these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill ,0

maybe they don t believe that wearing a mask helps i wear a mask at work because it is required and i wear them in public because it might slow the spread if i got infected but still what is the mortality rate of non nh residents mortality rate for children the hypocrisy of people saying all lives matter while acting in a way that shows all lives do not matter to them they can believe what they like but the evidence from studies is clear that face masks reduce the spread of meh i think the key thing it does is reduce the off gassing of infected droplets even n95 s are 100 effective ,0

how to put on use take off and dispose of a mask 1 remember a mask should only be used by health workers care takers and individuals with respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough 1 10 2 before touching the mask clean hands with an alcohol based hand rub or soap and water 2 10 3 take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes 3 10 4 orient which side is the top side where the metal strip is 4 10 5 ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards the coloured side 5 10 6 place the mask to your face pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose 6 10 7 pull down the mask s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin 7 10 8 after use take off the mask remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask 8 10 9 discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use 9 10 10 perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask use alcohol based hand rub or if visibly soiled wash your hands with soap and water 10 10 ,0

is covid 19 airborne i don t think it is but it would be good to confirm that if it s not then contact is needed to contract it if we take precautionary hygiene actions it will help reduce it s spread i d like incoming travel to stop temporarily oz has natural quarantine twitter s newsfeed says australians are being told not to fly overseas and the threat level is the highest in history true yes it s true although i still can not understand why schools are going to be open scomo i think the facts support him though very few cases of kids with it they could be carriers without symptoms possibly but what about the domino effect example if one of them came near my mum she would die due to her health issues the kids are more resilient but others are not that s my thinking personally i am thinking it is why else is it spreading like wildfire also it would have just been contained in wuhan i may be wrong but that s my view yes it is airborne and much of the spreading is due to that we re told to stay a minimum of 3 feet 1 meter from other people and 6 feet is strongly recommended when you cough it easily travels 3 feet 6 feet for a deep cough never touch your face ,0

should i wear a mask to protect myself only wear a mask if you are ill with covid 19 symptoms especially coughing or looking after someone who may have covid 19 the mask can only be used once if you are not ill looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask the most common symptoms of covid 19 are fever tiredness amp dry cough some patients may have aches amp pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually some people become infected but don t develop any symptoms are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the covid 19 no antibiotics do not work against viruses they only work on bacterial infections covid 19 is caused by a virus so antibiotics do not work is there a vaccine drug or treatment for covid 19 not yet to date there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat covid 2019 however those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms people with serious illness should be hospitalized is covid 19 the same as sars no the virus that causes covid 19 and the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars are related to each other genetically but they are different sars is more deadly but much less infectious than covid 19 can i catch covid 19 from my pet no there is no evidence that companion animals or pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the virus that causes covid 19 is there anything i should not do the following measures are not effective against covid 2019 and can be harmful 1 smoking 2 taking traditional herbal remedies 3 wearing multiple masks 4 taking self medication such as antibiotics in any case if you have fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider ,0

q could worsen disease for people with a based on currently available information who does not recommend against the use of of ibuprofen how to believe who see this january 15 info of who they can only go on the data that s available at the time no clear evidence of something doesn t mean it s definitely not happening just that they don t have scientific proof of it the science changes as we gather more data that s to be expected it would be helpful if didn t use double negatives to get out important messages notices thanks kind of a double negative here in your 1st post are you saying it is ok to use ibuprofen the 2nd post makes it seem like you re consulting physicians i love ibuprofen no one should ruin its reputation it complicates the illness how many double negatives can you have to make this more unclear to lessen understanding question will this virus come in waves over the next 18 months like the 1918 influenza did many effective alternatives to ibuprofen until further studies are forthcoming why take a chance except for people with diabetes and hypertension there is research to indicate ibroprofen can exacerbate the uptake of the virus thanks many governments seem to taken for granted that is is harmful though maybe is there no general agreement on this why do you use ibuprofen when it s not an antivirus human pathogenic coronaviruses bind target cells together using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 which can be increased by treatment with ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type i receptor blockers aka ibuprofen consequently the increased expression of ace2 would facilitate infection with covid 19 lei fang md phd postdoctoral researcher in the department of biomedicine at university hospital basel switzerland because this question has come up for people with heart disease prior heart attack stroke heart bypass or coronary stents who are taking baby aspirin acetylsalicylic acid or asa 81 mg please don t stop taking it because of covid 19 fears 1 2 2 2 there is no evidence whatsoever that baby aspirin puts you at risk with covid 19 despite the double negative if you read the entire statement the gist of the recommendation can be understood it is ok to use ibuprofen if no other contra indications exist based on available information this seems to be very reasonable based on currently available information is unhelpful it s a very broad okay for a very specific question it looks like a lab strain someone is trying to patent to have a science vendor sell its an attenuated virus meaning it s a weakened form not able to cause infection we need these types of things to make studying the virus easier in a lab setting thanks for the clarity ibuprofen is a commonly used drug so this helps but for me my va primary does say to avoid ibuprofen amp naproxen sodium check with your provider i wanted to pass this along to you it looks like the who is not asking people to stop taking ibuprofen hope this is further help to you guys thank you we stopped the ibuprofen sticking with tylenol please avoid using double negatives in your messaging that confuses the public especially those for whom english is no their first language thank you for all you are doing in this pandemic thanks for letting us know that s it s not not ok we will use tylenol for now and not advil ibuprofen just in case our local media was saying different thing who wants a future where only english majors have survived clunky wording with an unfortunate typo thrown in too these messages need to be clear and understood apparently there have been baseless reports with no evidence to back them up suggesting people stop their prescribed acei and arb meds needs to crack down on those and stop amp i m contemplating stopping the use of lisinopril which is an ace inhibitor i m so confused here are some myths about coronavirus that you must be aware of a response in plain language would help avoid confusion i recommend against who copywriters ibuprofen is known to cause severe complications in any viral diseases like dengue amp flu in sometime who would issue an advisory against the use of ibuprofen in covid it adversely affects the platelets amp kidneys as well wow kenapa cuman ibu profen ya atau karenaa kemarin kemarin menjadi apa yang di gadang2 buat nanganin demam panas penderita where can i find a link to this on the who website the search on the website didn t bring up anything on ibuprofen there s so much information on there unroll your tweet was quoted in an article by ictv based on taxonomy has determined that it belongs to the same species as the sars virus so they name the virussars cov 2 a serious sars outbreak in china 2003 and china guarantee to the ppl it will not happen again you cover and pleasing china by naming it covid 19 the virus is called sars cov 2 the disease is called covid 19 there is no cover up hi my friend says that a gathering of less than 5 people is harmless can you please tell me if that s true not a doctor but just use zoom or something can we get that in human terms plz amp ty poor wording who does not recommend against can confuse many people what if we don t have the disease i m having cramps what do i do your tweet was quoted in an article by i wonder why people will ever trust you after this you said human to human transmission wasn t possible in what happened there get this awareness song stay safe this too shall pass there are medical reports of covid19 patients locally treated with ibuprofen got better situation slower then the ones that don t it must do something how can i find the daily situation report easily on twitter we are at report 58 please tag them accordingly thanks can i take medication for the mild simptoms eg fever etc what about anti inflammatory my husband and myself are on it do not take ibuprofen advil or motrin especially younger people take acetaminophen tylenol instead terrible advice by again and what about azithromycin amp hcq what about ace inhibitors used for hypertension is there a risk of fatal associated with kindly clarify thanks can i get the link to the journal submission so i can read it for myself i would love to see the number of observations in this study which seem to be never mentioned thanks the infographics says of of ibuprofen how about turmeric or curcumin i don t understand it can be use que opinan los médicos mexas hey doc if spitting was the solution this wouldn t be a problem double negative there please clarify this tweet as to whether ibuprofen is generally recommended to treat or not has the company who manufactures most of the core ingredient being investigated after whistleblower complaints recently include taiwan in so we can fuckin help i don t know who does it this is the most confusing statement ever does not recommend against do we avoid it or not following this is better info perhaps people would be more clear on this topic without the double negative who should recommend against use of ibuprofen at any time infectious disease is a risk ibuprofen is contraindicated when heightened immune responses are needed these nsaids inhibit antibody production do not use what about now are you trying to raise the mortality rate of this thing paracetamol or tylenol is useless and the dangerous drug in the world i don t see any information about the use of ibuporfen on your web site are you going to post an update on this topic thank you a lot and if possible try to share which medicines we aren t supposed to take thanks is this the same with naproxen even if tylenol is better is crona virus found in chicken ficus religiosa thank you all for your dedication to preserving civilizations godspeed to you all in monitoring amp in research for relief to advance to effective doses for all sizes of us are you kidding thank you so much amp i don t know why some people s from some countries always sending wrong sms amp using name it s totally making wrong idea everyone crossing with a critical situation in the world don t have knowledge amp common sense this corona virus is only spreading in humans but not among the animals so please test these animals and find what makes them prevent from this virus please work on it i think it will comes with a positive solution thank you sir i have read many messages all says the homeopathic medicine called arsenic album is best for cure of covid 19 sir plz tell me is it right information could you please clarify you are cited to be telling otherwise spread the information who please improve your grammar usage and support the obvious issa double negative sir what is the recommend medicine for fever research and development of new drugs if agreed to do clinical treatment control experiments covid19 caused the immune cytotoxic war necrosis of the lungs there are medicines to cure immediately the control group can choose any product one thing virus in general is beyond our understanding we are still stone age technology primitive dna and genetic are like god evolution many years before we blood fight first step and find out first what or which good virus can eat bad virus what about ace and arbs mobile world television world life is an criteria even to solve this entire universe there are mostly two types of patients we found in every house 1 god s patients 2 doctor s patients mobile world television world well good cause i take 1600 plus mgs a day for pain to avoid narcotics i guess this is the difference between biochemical studies amp in vivo ones diseases don t read textbooks the ace theory makes sense but if not observed in practice a pinch of salt is needed but is still advised to avoid for a large group of people including asthmatics who may have worse symptoms i hope your recovery and isolation are going well following nsaid comment on last night this who guidance in alignment with esc and ema should be the basis of guidance to patients on nsaid use in suspected covid 19 good luck with bouncing back ibrufen and other related groups multiply the multiplication process of in italy one of the reason for excessive deaths of patients is the intake of ibrufen so must be avoided are vaccines for avian influenza a virus that works on virus corona curious where it s made thank you because stuff like this is concerning me that people will believe everything on social media whoever is in your publication department needed to proofread does not and against in the same sentence evan thank you for checking this out i do appreciate dear who maybe you need to be a bit more clear many will only see this who does not recommend and not the rest and go around giving wrong info thank you overexpression of ace in myeloid immune and epithelial cells results in ca recruitment could ace also result in calcium chloride associated fluid retention relevant to covid19 lung filling if so could potassium supplementation along with zinc help balance that regarding covid 19 people are reporting permanent damage to lungs and other organs if they are infected does this happen with every case of covid 19 or just the ones that require more intense treatment what else is china saying mr official spekesperson and could worsen disease for well then can i take a herbal extract instead of a genetic chemical formula for what s going on draw blood from the one who heals from corona and give it to the injured where did this rumor start ibuprofen lowers body temp making the virus happy pyrexia good bussin out them double negatives that s a double negative so who recommends taking ibuprofen collodial silver vinegar chaga mushrooms vitamin c thats all you need why can t you just say you do recommend ibuprofen for treating fever for patients with covid 19 does not against double negative anyone i noticed this isn t on the mythbusters page yet will it be added bitter kola is good for lung infection but is it effective for coronavirus it is not chinese virus it is ccp bio weapon originated in wuhan chinazi ask them to turn off the tap while lathering their hands please share this that everyone should knows about it you are giving a confusing message in first tweet you said will recommend to not use it now not what about the newest rumors of using elderberry the double negative does not recommend against is causing confusion for people i had to read it out loud to make sure i wan t misunderstanding it myself please invent medicine for the covid 19 virus please request you w h o no evidence of links between ibuprofen and infections what about the study made by the french administration for drug safety in april 2019 i say don t use ibuprofen it clearly seems to be becoming an issue for people i m prettt sure someone already talks about ace2 which is basically ibuprofen just google it i say it s a no go especially since some people are very much so having a reaction is this still the official statement is saying otherwise as of an hour

it s crazy how expensive insurance premiums have become and how healthcare has become tied to employment when we treat healthcare like a commodity to be bought and sold where third parties can make trillions how could we expect the result to be anything other than this look when i preheat the oven to 425 put the pizzas i made for dinner in that mutherfucker and 15 minutes later they re cooked it doesn t surprise anyone it was built to do this why then are we so surprised in this country when the systems work the way they were designed we re so tribal amp divided i mean who could ve predicted such a thing resulting from a strict binary setup that was built upon still unresolved issues of slavery amp colonial imperialism you preheat the oven to a certain temperature don t be surprised when shit gets cooked so the only option we have is a hard reopen of the economy in the middle of a pandemic when you have an economy that was built to favor those with generational wealth largely on the backs of those who weren t allowed to create it and no real social safety net i guess so ,0

so people assume how many remain susceptible can be estimated by subtracting those with positive antibodies serology from the total is this consistent with what is being observed 9 x a ubiquitous assumption made is that at the start all in the population are susceptible if exposed to a new virus such as sar cov 2 but is this assumption always correct 7 x as a pandemic evolves the susceptible are consider to be those that remain after one excludes those infected and recovered it is difficult to precisely determine at a given time who is infected because of the dynamic nature of the disease 8 x most serologic assays have ranged from 1 3 all the way up to 20 30 in areas such as new york city and the curve seems to be ending in nyc what gives 10 x similarly in a recent study of an isolated alpine community in austria shows that even in a close knit community only a fraction of people became infected 11 x it seems the pandemic has stopped in that community with a high antibody prevalence of 42 4 notably children were less likely to be infected 12 x in another study it was also shown that children are less likely to be infected with a hypothesis being that this is driven by lower expression of the ace2 receptor 13 x another fascinating study of a ship expedition to the antarctic showed that even in close proximity a significant faction of people did not become infected h t 14 x so it seems likely we cannot estimate the fraction of susceptible individuals by merely determining this by the lack of specific sar cov 2 protective antibodies 15 x how could this be is it possible not all are likely to be infected i suspect this is multifactorial and mostly hypothetical i will share two possibilities others have explored 16 x the most likely explanation is that there are some mechanisms that have evolved over the course of human primates mammal evolution and that there is some possibility of cross immunity derived from other coronaviruses 17 x this is hard to prove but it is possible that evolution has selected traits making humans more resilient to coronaviruses exposure perhaps our ancestors or even lemurs already had major existential threats in the past thank you 18 x how could we be protected it is impossible to tell our knowledge about coronaviruses is limited as is true for most science maybe polymorphisms in receptors immunity or other ways we might never know but we do know evolutionary pathways select 19 x another possibility is cross reactivity to other coronaviruses one such study has shown that as a possibility they found t cell reactivity from viable t cells stored before sars cov 2 in nearly one half of cases 20 x this study was small but very provocative if confirmed this means that these individuals with such reactivity would need to be subtracted from the s as in susceptible in other words you can be functionally immune even if not exposed 21 x importantly and somewhat obvious they will not have typical sar cov 2 antibodies but they may still have protective cross reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses 22 x it would be fascinating to test for such immunity and antibodies in close contacts of infected individuals who did not become sick low hanging fruit 23 x modern science has the capability of presenting an array of targets proteome of coronaviruses to test for the presence of these antibodies 24 x it is possible a high viral dose can overcome some level of cross immunity that would explain why there are clusters among families or friends and also some of the cases reported in healthcare workers 25 x globally we have heard from colleagues in peru ecuador and greece saying the parking lots were full we had no more beds they are gone 26 x the problem is we have no reliable way of knowing who is susceptible and how is not i do not recommend anyone reads this as a way to relax our safety measures but hopefully this give you hope 27 x highly recommends i read the a camus book highly descriptive of the current situation 28 x in the meantime stay safe use masks in public quarantine yourself if ill and remain hopeful 29 x ,0
debunking about the new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through mosquito bites it is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose debunking about garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties however there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus debunking about this is a misinformation spreading all over the social media and whatsapp no such action has been planned out by the indian government debunking about no snorting cocaine or drinking alchohol does not protect against covid 19 it s a highly addictive thing that causes serious side effects and is harmful to people s health debunking about eating ice cream does not make a difference to coronavirus infections neither cold nor hot temperatures can kill coronavirus debunking about gargling with salt water can ease a sore throat but it won t kill the virus the has said that there is no evidence that regularly rinsing your nose with saline is likely to prevent infection with the new coronavirus ,0

are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus no antibiotics do not work against viruses only bacteria the best way to protect yourself against is by frequently cleaning your hands by doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes mouth and nose hand dryers are not effective in killing to protect yourself against the new you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water can an ultraviolet disinfection lamp kill the new uv lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as uv radiation can cause skin irritation thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever i e have a higher than normal body temperature because of infection with the new however they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever this is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes i e eyes mouth be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus no vaccines against pneumonia such as pneumococcal vaccine and haemophilus influenza type b hib vaccine do not provide protection against the new are there any specific medicines to prevent or treat the new coronavirus to date there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus 2019 ncov however those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care ,0

but sporting events concerts disney are all closed for a reason covid 19 is just like the flu realistically we will all eventually get this just like we have all had the flu before but this is a new virus that needs to be slowed down for our medical field to catch up tower thread the fact people are going out to crowded public areas bars for the most part is mind boggling yes younger people under 55 60 are mildly effected for the most part unless you have a preexisting illness but any age is still just as contagious as the next you can have covid 19 and not show a single symptom then go visit your grandparent parent and pass to them who will a more serious chance of being effected from a health standpoint so many people are so uneducated on covid 19 yes the media has completely overblown this the only way to allow the medical field to catch up is social distance yourself if you do not social distance yourself then the virus will spread rapidly e i china amp italy causing medical facilities to max out with people left waiting with covid 19 that may or may not be in a critical condition on top of that that it s the fact if we let this spread and facilities fill up then you have the scenarios of a heart attack victim not being about to have the services needed due to the facilities being maxed out it s not a beat it it s a slow it down as young people in society it s our duty to slow this virus down avoid social gatherings avoid large crowds wash your fucking hands wipe down machines at the gym socially distance yourself if you have mindset of i m young and this really doesn t effect me then not only are you being selfish but you re the route cause for spreading in 2 weeks the people out in public crowds now are going to be the same people complaining when all nonessential companies medical emergency food sources are closed for 3 weeks to try and control all this ,1

herd immunity no sooner than november 4th correct love your books but love when more your passion for the truth also vaccines are more lucrative than good old cheap common sense herd immunity national action requires a pelosi congress who would allocate everybody s savings away and destroy the economy this has always been the plan it was done against bush with not even a twitch and they expect to do it again in brazil this information is coming from blood banks which test every donation in rio de janeiro the antibody rate went from 4 in april to 14 in may and 28 in the beginning of june in the us the red cross should certainly have this info why isn t it available that s a great point antibody tests are important if for no other reason they still don t know how long the antibodies last and or resist reinfection no one has yet to be able to answer that but i assume they are still testing to determine who knows my bro works for a biotech company who makes covid tests and because covid mutates so slowly unlike influenza there should be lasting immunity which also means if enough people get it it will fade away completely just like sars and mers both coronaviruses are you new to this that s a pretty common sun tues rate of change because the tyrannical idiots running the show need to take credit for herd immunity s work harris county s mask edict has just been extended until late august by which time this would have been over any way but now the can say see look at what my mask edict accomplished yikes that makes sense but it s so sickening in it s sneakiness what about the cdc anti body testing done in late march early april in the early days everyone said this can t be a hoax because the whole world is locking down ok fair now flip the situation why is only the us locking down to this extent again red cross in va at least is testing every person donating blood for covid19 antibodies for a limited time lowest us death total for a tuesday since march 25 i imagine team apocalypse will still be screaming for lockdowns when we hit zero deaths top uk oncologist prof karol sikora is trying to help people in the uk you and others with a big audience must keep asking for this and promoting it until decision makers get it keep up the great work right after the election same thing is happening in houston smh so why hasn t gov abbott been mentioning this of late if at all great work alex of the recent pandemics which ones have the designed successful vaccines aids hiv colds sars mers h1n1 they only get the flu right every once in a while governor polis just shut down bars for 30 days is actively discouraging companies universities etc from doimg any antibody testing elections agreed vaccine is aqcuired immunity in the herd otherwise it s natural herd immunity people that think vaccines are the answer don t realize they are actually for herd immunity they don t realize vaccines are not harmless either ohio was supposed to have the results of theirs in may for some reason we are still waiting airlines are obv businesses amp they have been working on a committee with the president to get back to opening up our country fireworks at the state level xcld bc some govs dont want happiness amp prosperity or anything positive happening that would help trump get re elected a friend asked his dr to authorixe antibody test in utah dr said not reliable enough amp wouldn t what s happening in nc that s my question i live in nc yeah be a real shame if herd immunity was achieved naturally before a vaccine can be rushed to market nih has been performing one results will be out in the next month or two 112 n no a v because reliable tests aren t out there alex be careful with antibody tests body deals usually so easy with the sars cov 2 that most of people don t even develop antibodies is that when the often mentioned t cells come into the picture i m not sure what you mean but maybe i get some of it i believe that there are no coincidences ever so how is it that all the events happening are right on time for something how can the virus do what it s doing very methodically and specifically at certain times and places alex what s happening in nc i live here and all i hear is gloom and doom despite the numbers our own illustrious dashboard tells us great article new york city antibody results were over 20 two months ago i would expect that they are much higher now but there has been silence on that issue assuming 20 positive on nyc antibody test that would mean a potential of 2 million positive test results from nyc alone my guess is the real antibody results in nyc are much higher which is good news not bad news of course because it leads to herd immunity it s even more fundamental novo wuhan virus found in waste water samples in spain in early 2019 the whole fauci narrative was bs from day one the deaths are seasonal predictable and many are the result of malpractice it s irrelevant because by fall the daily deaths rate will be approaching zero they won t be able to hide that glaring fact i suspected long ago that this would be very slow in coming since it endangers the narrative the cdc says for every 1 case we identified there were at least 10 we didn t fauci claimed yesterday the us would see 100 000 cases per day do the math we have been well over his number for some time we are now identifying those by testing people who aren t ill and two months ago they said that s what needed to happen more testing to identify and isolate cases and those people with no symptoms now they are saying that s bad bad because well that s a lot of cases i feel like we are being punked nefarious they want this to continue or incompetence pharmaceutical industrial complex has fda eua approved covid 19 antibody tests available for immediate delivery to approved government and healthcare facilities this will help identify those with antibodies antibody tests are not accurate enough to base any clinical decisions around talk to a doctor or someone in the clinical chemistry molecular or microbiology field they will tell you the same thing new research from karolinska institutet and karolinska university hospital shows that many people with mild or asymptomatic covid 19 demonstrate so called t cell mediated immunity to the new coronavirus even if they have not tested positively for antibodies probably because they re saying the tests are inaccurate what are you referring to in nc fredericksburg va this morning my husband was talked out of antibody test by doctor because she said they re inconclusive and pointless my wife and i did our part to reduce the death rate by surviving covid it wasn t fun but almost everyone who get it survives including almost every person in the u s workforce have politicized covid because restarting the economy helps trump likely adding the number of positive antibodies test results in with the covid positive results it s easier to fluff the numbers that way cause it is all covid herd immunity will never be achieved for corona viruses just like it doesn t exist for influenza viruses it will or mutate and become part of life or mutate and disappear my guess is the second one it can t mutate and disappear bc literally natural selection also coronavirus family don t drift antigenically with a rate remotely resembling influenza the red cross is now offering free antibody testing with a blood donation hopefully that data will be aggregated and released also i look forward to seeing this one on in two weeks well you live in ny enjoy while good news think we ve a longer way to go to get to herd immunity alex what s happening in n c haven t seen any stats their website is not much help no actual number for hospitalization and nothing about antibodies cc the nc study is not randomized these volunteers are self selected i haven t requested an antibody test because i don t think i have had the virus please stop calling it a randomized study according to these swedish researchers antibody tests under count infected by 2x nyc could easily be at 60 if they are right what is happening in nc it s funny seeing people talk about the ins and outs of things like herd immunity and nucleic acid anti body test that probably never heard of any of those things 3 months ago compare to other countries if we are so far behind then other countries must assuredly be ahead of us i don t think it s that easy in the early stages the virus is too spotty go get a grip on it for something useful dude are you arguing herd immunity is achieved at 30 nyc seroprevalence is around 25 and we see immunity playing a huge role not abolishing the virus as herd would but it s ability to spread is extremely limited in ny angry twitter man has found all the answers arithmetic has good reason to be angry with us all these days and t cell immunity seems to be more widespread than antibodies new york italy etc seems to show that we re nearing herd immunity like it or not not sure about doing things ny or italian style they basically euthanized the vulnerable by using nursing homes for cv19 patients mental midgets hundo p i thought nih was doing this i volunteered but apparently was not selected madness we are in the hands of luddites cretins amp i think you are gonna be right or close but the evidence will be i think on worldometer or similar deaths for sure are way down let s see if the cases graph falls like a rock soon i hope so we will not see a widespread accurate antibody test because each person who tests positive is one less customer for a vaccine shot um no i don t know if you noticed but new york was a bit tense while all that was going on confirmation for all the just wait two weeks ninnies karens and npcs they are gonna fight hard but keep sharing the data can t hide from the truth it could be that there are so many reliability problems with the antibody testing kits what s happening in nc what did i miss why is not demanding this another day another article now they say test for t cells and not for antibodies for every person testing positive for antibodies two were found to have specific t cells which identify and destroy infected cells do we know what to test can you try to make these results available and that would wipe out the pretext for mail in voting in november gotta make it last to november then it will all go silent we don t know because the cdc is not treating this viral disease like a real emergency that requires excellent data and surveillance they are treating it like a political bludgeon clear data would hamper their mission so what is the end game here who is benefitting from falsely keeping us all in panic the only semblance of malice i can think of is that some public health experts have a tiny bit more amount of fame antibody tests that are positive for antibodies is like having your own vaccine on board do more testing for antibodies viral tests when symptomatic can someone more well informed than myself please explain to me if it s possible to have both t cells and antibodies present for the same pathogen or do the t cells if present automatically override cancel out the abs did you see this study from karolina ka in sweden suggestion antibody testing may be understating the infection and immunity rates because many people don t produce antibodies but produce an effective t cell immune response remember when birx said on april 1 2020 there is no more flu after that day any flu deaths were counted as covid we stupidly went along and believed anything they said meanwhile arizona hospitals have received the go ahead to use crisis standards of care resources are being rationed and people are dying that could have been saved might wanna do a bit more research on antibody testing you will never get that data the last thing democrats want is the true on this hoax to get out they want us wearing bacterial laden petri dishes on our faces to make us sick so that in october when we all have respiratory illnesses they can yell covid covid see its covid no voting in person close the polls so i heard someone on oan news said that the numbers of new cases are being cooked but my thought is what if it s worse than that what if they are using manipulated test kits somehow it s surely possible every other thing going on this graph represents herd immunity isn t this what we want of course they can manage to produce tests that over report positives by 50 but not antibody testing it s like the media wants to propagate the scam as if they have a motive to harm the leader of the country s popularity or something the cdc has shown itself to be another incompetent self perpetuating government bureaucracy random covid19 testing should have started in january 2020 without random testing you have no idea of what s happening the cdc is clueless so let s just let it spread and we will find out hey dr you retweeting crazy conspiracy theories is really going to help out win those center moderate voters keep up the great work i ve been asking this the whole it s odd herd immunity would upset the plans mail in ballots fear for control vaccines for all contact tracing which really is the ground work for social score most of all marxist take over they don t want this to end anything to prolong the assault on liberties and freedom and anything to get rid of trump what is happening in nc a little background of truth nc is just now starting to test nursing home residents and workers in the facilities just now 50 of nc deaths are from nursing homes looking at the real stats blame the idiot in chief if you are uncovering asymptomatic infections in a major way we are closer to the end of the pandemic than most people realize isn t it the darkest before dawn i hope you are right i want this over i can t take it anymore we are being scammed the testing and metrics for case positive numbers are shit positive because u maybe talked to someone with covid this whole situation is completely fucked with a bunch of morons pointing to data that is worthless out of the gate junk in junk out open the country now posting this again this seems to be correct and this they are all going to deny herd immunity until november 4 their followers are not exactly difficult to manipulate nj governor just paused indoor dining although covid burned out here months ago explain the what is happening in nc is happening everywhere earlier tonight there was a report that north carolina antibody testing showed 17 exposure implying a very low ifr which would mean the virus has fewer to infect and is not as lethal to those it does why did they scream in march we need more tests now we are doing it and now they are like shut it down the left gives me a headache really come on why are you giving us this information ,0

this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of what was he thinking of via it is definitely a hoax the swedish names of the people involved allude to sex he was just doing it for the buzzzzzzzz not a bees or wasps nest this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of via perhaps the birds and the bees doesn t translate so well into swedish as a swede i get suspicious where his neighbour is named standingboner true though i should have realized the hoax when i read the neighbor s name which means boner in swedish noac was it sting love that the article named the neighbour mr hard on bet he got a buzz from it some people really do deserve everything they get if he wanted his member swollen his wish was certainly fulfilled sadly it s not true i love that psychologist and expert on sexual fantasies said sex with hornets nest bad idea expert not needed for that his missus must be a heifer that he went for the safer option death where is thy sting the swedes have the strangest fetishes closer to nature you say rt dead body in ystad stung to death by hornets surely wallander must investigate this omgness thanks for sharing i lead such a sheltered life thank god seems life in sweden is really rough if they are forced to do it obviously not a true story neighbor s name means boner lol an extremely bad idea lol stååhfräs is swedish for boner spelled in a innovative way it s a joke which got lost in translation trend this spread the word looks like they stuck it back to him and then some what a way to go eh i just hope they don t play this at his funeral p sorry lmao funniest hoax ever rt this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of via right now it feels heavy and unreal that s some neighbourly thing to do i feel chuffed when i accept a parcel for mine a hoax indeed neighbour s name is slang for erection in swedish don t suppose he got much of a buzz out of it my response to this is hillarious and most definitley a hoax the neighbour s name ståhfrääs the h amp one ä is slang for erection meanwhile in sweden this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of via wow twas a hoax m dear translate the neighbour s name into english you ll get bertil boner they ve just intentionally misspelled ståfräs i nominate that man for a darwin award just a case of never mind the buzz cocks the metro are now saying the story seems to be fake no evidence man existed death by a thousand pr cks perhaps lx metaphorically sure we ve all been where we got stung but literally 3 months of freezing darkness maybe a cause the human mind that prompts these actions is unbelievable jo tjena bertil ståhfrääs rt this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of horny for a hornet whatever next of sweden and his duty judging by his neighbours reaction i reckon the poor chap was very lonely he was trying to immunize his penis against allergies i adored the documentary on wagner you looked gorgeous too the semen pubic hairs and fingerprints on the nest were what finally pegged my incredulity gauge good one loving that stingy feeling he should be nominated for a darwin award that s what i call a sting in the tail considering that his neighbour s last name translates to boner id say this is fake i feel like making a lot of horny hornet jokes but i won t i imagine it was something along the lines of owowowowowowowowowaaaaa the neighbors last name ståhfrääs means a hard on guys it was a honey trap he just wanted an easy buzz why have i not heard of this and i m in sweden and not even that far from ystad hard to beat there are those who get turned on by having their own limbs amputated luckily its a short lived obsession i would guess the hornets were just reacting to being poked never poke a hornets nest obviously you might get stung this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of what was he thinking of wtf quote of the week to attempt to have intercourse with a hornet s nest is a very bad idea sounds like nobody told him about the birds and the bees where s the buzz in that fav quote from the article to attempt to have intercourse with a hornet s nest is a very bad idea i genuinely hope that s a real name i didn t know it until now but i ve always wanted that to be my name come on stephen we ve all done it this is just about the weirdest fetish via clear candidate 4 darwin awards someone nominate to attempt to have intercourse with a hornet s nest is a very bad idea surely the understatement to end them all he understood fucking horny wrong rt weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of what was he thinking of suicide by hornet the neighbours name is bertil boner it is a joke clue the neigbour s name ståhfrääs means erection i love the expert quote they get to attempt to have intercourse with a hornet s nest is a very bad idea hahaha funny but very unlikely the neighbour s surname means hard on this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of what was he thinking of via mm don t suppose a pooter savvy friend told him to get into whore net the neighbors last name translates to bertil hard on that s the weirdest fetish i can think of is unfortunately likely to provide tweets detailing 100 weirder ones seems delightful i m afraid it s probably a hoax hope he came before he went deadly buzz stephen he weas thinking of sex wierd sex but sex just today we were talking about dying while doing what one loves we were thinking about sports looks like a hoax try each to their own i guess but i think he did it for the buzz what s weirder is that his neighbour thought he was a whale carcass in sweden on a farm his father had not long told him about the birds n the bee s this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of what was he thinking of via unfortunate quote from the neighbour his scrotum was enlarged right now it feels heavy and unreal its a hoax theres only 3 people youd want with you at worlds end ray mears and stephen hawking but only for wheelchair parts we ve all been there the best way to stir up a hornet s nest probably oww oww oww oww aaahhhhhh oh stephen i love that the conclusion drawn by the sex expert psychologist was having intercourse with a hornet s nest was a bad idea take away the pain keep the swelling wonder if i ll get hives perhaps it seems to as a fake article as this neighbour bertil ståhfrääs sounds weird translated to eng bertil boner maybe he was just trying to get a buzz but why did his neighbour weigh his scrotum the neighbour s name is a sexual pun in swedish it s a joke its not real news it was from a swedish satire site i doubt that this is true considering the fact that the neighbours name is hard on in swedish considering his neighbour s surname translates to erection i d agree that it s a hoax the neighbour s name ståhfrääs actually means hard on but spelled as if it was a peer s name actually it s not real gotta understand swedish to get it hmm according to this it isn t true but i don t know what their sources are do you think it could be murder the mind boggles i feel sick how stupid can anyone be so bizarre some people s kids i tell ya buzzing hmm and awkward juxtaposition in these sentences the scrotum was enlarged right now it feels heavy and unreal what a prick nay thousands o holy cackamoley can i get my jollies doing this was probably it obvioulsly a very bad case of insexst neighbour bertil ståhfrääs boner hard on in the swedish paper the psychologist was named siv underlivh pelvic i can t even just what seriously gast is officially flabbered nope didn t happen in swedish the neighbours last name translates to hardon so hoax yes propably oh deary deary me buzzarre story isn t true he was obviously looking for the ultimate buzz wow it is not real mr ståfrähs means having a boner my good gods this is not only horrible but kind of stupid to boot brilliant that s blatantly a hoax the neighbour s last name is swedish slang for hard on the hornet s nest was clearly begging for it story was a hoax what a way to go it was a freak accident like those chaps with vacuum cleaners i was just walking along in my dressing gown albeit sad it was a hoax stephen bertil ståhfrääs amp siv underlivh are swedish for erection and fetish it s god thinning the herd this is just about the weirdest fetish i ve ever heard of 4th last paragraph 1st sentence sorry to disappoint you this is clearly fake however funny well better than a sting in the tail it is most definitely not true but still funny there s one sentence in there that proclaims the whole report to be fabrication yep ståhfrääs is not a very serious name for a swede at least he got a buzz out of it shudder agh bit of a sting in the tail name of neighbour ståhfrääs might have tipped u off if fluent in swedish translates to hard on boner erection etc considering his neighbor s last name translates to hard on i recommend being sceptical about this one question is what was he thinking with is more apt a sting in the tail tale perhaps x the neighbor s last name ståfräs is a funny swedish word for boner guess you just learned some good to know swedish he must have got a buzz out of it that s no way to bee hive how sad and uncomfortable happens to the best of us top five hoax news stories seeing as the neighbours surname would translate to hard on ,1

it s used in emergency situations and in combination with other drugs the fda commissioner and cdc have both said it s still in trials but may work my point is that saying covid 19 is just like the flu and we have drugs already is reckless at best the fda approved a drug that has no clinical trials nor proof of working for covid 19 so we re all good is a terrible argument opium isn t a new drug either just because a drug has been used for one thing doesn t mean it will work on another and there is currently zero proof chloraquine will kill off covid 19 so assuming everything will be fine because of said drug is dangerous it is an anti viral drug with zero proof that it works on covid 19 at this time the south korean groups warned that there is currently no standard treatment for covid 19 patients showing severe pneumonia like symptoms high risk groups including the elderly and the chronically ill are target groups for a more active administration of the drugs the treatments for a flu are tested for months or years chloroquine has just started fda clinical trials for treatment of covid 19 i hope a treatment is found no matter where it comes from i just don t like the hyping of a drug as the cure when it hasn t been fully tested ,1

but no surprise the first general killed in a combat zone as a matter of fact he did he was probably on vacation totally agree with you would be the correct and patriotic thing to do love too see a veteran in wyoming call donald trump a fucking mutant agree he doesn t care he has no class whatsoever 100 so have you now joined westborough baptist church in turning funerals into political circuses absolutely disgusting this man is an embarrassment for the office and usa this is sickening please stop were you there king o has no time except for himself golf and campaigning the court jesters rule the land i agree the purging of cmbt tested com staff almost complete yes men in place hussein is very close to declaring mart law he is on vacation on the vineyard no time for work complain when he does something and complain when he doesn t typical conservative mentality i m surprised you haven t commented on shooting in ferguson damn racist obeezy is never good enough for you punk too bad he can not interfere 4 marine in mexico but he can on brown s issue you re 100 right obama has no respect for anything that pertains to american values especially military the real travesty being former president bush putting mg greene in a position to be killed don t think i heard him even utter a word of sorrow or condolences too busy w amp does it really shock u it probably would ve interfered on his back 9 shows how much class he has ferguson is more important now it s his little way of showing contempt for the people who keep him in power he was golfing amen worst president in the history of america and that s coming from a w bush hater golf came first for president vacation it is especially since you sent him in there did you go donald if not why did any member of congress go while on vacation for 6wks if not stfu get a life donald i only wish i could steal as good as you so i could be a billionaire he can be everywhere and nowhere his death is sad but is his life worth more than the other soldiers lost during a war that shouldn t be he was too busy going to a late night talk show golf basketball game he was a general not a jihad that was the reason why he did not attend the funeral why do you hate on obama all the time the president doesn t go to soldiers funerals because you shouldn t give more weight to one soldiers death over another donald you re wrong it would be a travesty had he attended what do you expect from him donald he is busy playing cover up for al assad indirect support and regional failure yse ygyt it s the the 1st time i ever agreed with something trump had to say i do not think a president in the past was able to attend every memorial service have we forgetten the one he did attend we as americans that stand loyal with our troops can t expect nothing less from a narcissist obama is a very sick man every word that you speak further confirms you as a petty narrow minded partisan moron have you attended the funeral of every employee thats died while working for you atravesty why it won t bring him back or make it any easier it doesn t help me any you are a fucking troll lmao have you just woke up from your snoring sleep to recognize barack obama as president of usa and c in c shame he could ve at least mention him in one of his many rants true to that sir add it to the mountain of travesties he and his gang have committed nothing new here he s the golfer in chief not the commander just ask anyone in the military shut up trump did you go you think you re the president no one wanted that sob in attendance only real americans were welcome rt palestinian children aspire to death as martyrs everyone yearns for suicide killing nor did vp biden or sec of defense hagel disgraceful did you go donald if not sit down and stfu the adults are talking the butthurt is so strong in you romney didn t serve but i bet you voted for him anyway palin didn t paul ryan didn t cheney didn t obama is a travesty no surprise in oh so many ways by the way looters aren t thieves they re criminals guilty of serious felonies travesty you are such a fucking moron if you felt so strongly about it why did you attend what a fucking drama queen you and lindsey grahm must have a case of the tight ass vapors he didn t know about it he didn t see it on the news the president is more concerned with his golf game and vacation very sad sends a bad message to the military the prez has serious issues with his golf swing i mean have you seen it it looks like a caveman killing lunch was bush there rumsfeld cheney what about the oil ceo s who s interests we are there for in the first place why is this different than any other soldier kiled in combat did you go the man is busy running the world so shut your pie hole the real travesty is obama he did the family a favor by keeping his worthless face out of view a travesty of what besides if he had attended people would just complain that he was ignoring his other duties right fuck obama every man has his faults he was smart in the sense of getting votes from mexicans by opening the border pretty sure he s more occupied one word miles google sure was this thug shows no respect to military because he was playing golf on my corse is it necessary no excuse not even if he was playing a trump course he should be removed from office immediately oh grow up you don t lead by good example there is nothing honorable in constantly finding fault w potus hey don i ll give you a chico stick and tub of i can t believe it s not butter for your toupee hit me up dog did you really think he would give up a vacation day obama is just titled commander and chief as well as potus neither makes it so what a disgraceto our country bama b bizzzzy nelson it s a travesty people are out to find fault irrelevant to the post don s a genius he overcomes amp triumphs i agree with you sir his actions prove how little regard he really has for our military and veterans did you attend cheap politics was cheney there w when he does go to funerals or memorials he plays footsie with female heads of state and takes selfies it just wasn t a good time vacation plans were already made ,1

they also recognise that the huge improvements in contact tracing represent the justification for asking the public to surrender some of their rights successful and appropriate use of the app relies on it com manding well founded public trust and confidence the former head of no less a famously privacy loving body than mi5 has also stressed that success or failure of a contact tracing app relies on the state being absolutely transparent and communicative with citizens to earn their trust you will be used to seeing me complain that the state is doing data protection infringing things but to be clear i think a well designed and implemented app is necessecary and proportionate to our current circumstances my fear is that the gov are risking that aim with secrecy and so i find myself in the strange position of asserting that if the state has nothing to hide re it s corona tracking app it should have nothing to fear from letting everyone know all about it as you say currently we don t need an app to track people we meet because for most of us they re just the people we live with the app is part of a toolkit to allow society to carefully try to restore some normality even in the absence of a vaccine 1 you don t get it do you the app is for when we do start going out and about even more than we are now lockdown in ireland has been half arsed at best imagine if the govt had tried to implement protocols similar to spain s ,0

what is seasonality if not transient herd immunity it seems to me we don t really understand seasonality but we guess it s to do with temperature sunlight or being outdoors do we basically have a herd immunity threshold of 20 antibodies in summer and 60 antibods in winter rupert when did you become convinced there would be a substantial seasonal effect was it when lockdown releases failed to cause rebounds as envisaged in paper 9 if so what else do you infer from the non rebounds convinced not convinced i just think it s likely but why do you think it is likely did you always think is would be seasonal or is this a new view based on the observation that the disease according to the data seems to be taking a break if it s taking a break why can t we book summer holidays even back in feb i though it was likely to be seasonal but i also felt unless we suppress aggressively it won t make a difference halving r to 1 5 is irrelevant if have 1m point prevalence but seasonality and low r from lockdown synergise no seasonality is about lowering average r due to factors that will include behaviour less cramming together indoors susceptibility cold nose viable virus longevity in environment etc not about antibodies for common cold v short lived immunity may also play part the way i think about it individual immunity isn t the only factor in determining the herd immunity threshold susceptibility including behaviour is equally important or more so if ppl have bad snot or cold noses what s the difference behaviour hard to model maybe ,0

what are the symptoms of covid 19 the most common symptoms of covid 19 are fever tiredness and dry cough some patients may have aches and pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea these symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low however many people with covid 19 experience only mild symptoms this is particularly true at the early stages of the disease it is therefore possible to catch covid 19 from someone who has for example just a mild cough and does not feel ill you can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading covid 19 by taking some simple precautions regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and water why washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands maintain at least 1 metre 3 feet distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing why when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus if you are too close you can breathe in the droplets including the covid 19 virus if the person coughing has the disease avoid touching eyes nose and mouth why hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses once contaminated hands can transfer the virus to your eyes nose or mouth from there the virus can enter your body and can make you sick make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene this means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze then dispose of the used tissue immediately why droplets spread virus by following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold flu and covid 19 stay home if you feel unwell if you have a fever cough and difficulty breathing seek medical attention and call in advance follow the directions of your local health authority why national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility this will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections keep up to date on the latest covid 19 hotspots cities or local areas where covid 19 is spreading widely if possible avoid traveling to places especially if you are an older person or have diabetes heart or lung disease why you have a higher chance of catching covid 19 in one of these areas for more information please contact us e mail info com ,0

studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air see previous answer on how does covid 19 spread older people and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure heart problems or diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person other people then catch covid 19 by touching these objects or surfaces then touching their eyes nose or mouth people can also catch covid 19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with covid 19 who coughs out or exhales droplets this is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 3 feet away from a person who is sick who is assessing ongoing research on the ways covid 19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air can covid 19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms the main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing the risk of catching covid 19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low ,0

how long is the incubation period for covid 19 the incubation period means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease most estimates of the incubation period for covid 19 range from 1 14 days most commonly around five days so many patients need to be tested our lost 3 critical weeks to do what know needs to be done 94 of such cases are evident by 10 14 days that s why i agree with that incorrect the only country that has provided facts and effective quarantine policies and treatment is s korea and they have documented cases of 28 days symptoms of covid 19 appear within two to 14 days after exposure and include fever cough runny nose and difficulty breathing we are looking for symptoms onset it is understandable we look at probability to the 99 99 tile incorrect but i will be patient and we will re examine this tweet and cdc s information we ve seen the cases of people being exposed and didn t present with s s up to 28 days as we collect more data this will be updated no one knows the final answer but consensus is 1 14 day key word being estimates also saying 94 of cases the incubation period is up to 14 days that leaves 6 of the cases are longer than 14 days lt that s a huge impact of spreading ncov19 like i said we will most definitely reevaluate this information in the future ,0

fact of the day 5g mobile networks do not spread covid 19 don t forget to inform thes masses about the amount of radiation it gives off amp the effects it ll have on their health we ll then come back for conspiracy theories where is the peer reviewed evidence that it does iam sure 5g has its own health issues but there is no link between 5g and covid 19 i don t know how true this is but if it is how then do we curb the spread if departments are telling people to go back to work 5g doesn t cause covid 19 and those who say 5g causes radiation there s two type ionising and non ionising the bad one is the ionising and the one that s good is the non ionising of which frequencies are measured by means of electromagnetic spectrum big scepticism towards any facts the media puts forward with so many contradicting facts flowing around best to accept the safest version especially if these facts are not substantiated by trustworthy sources if 5g is faster and it spreads this virus does this mean 4g and the rest was then slowly making us sick dont they all have to some extend emit radiation you ll really need to give us hard evidence to prove what you are saying of course but we will keep destroying them because they are harmful is it right for a general worker at a private hospital to be sent to a public hospital when they have signs of contracting covid 19 which they picked up at work facts mus be followrd up with proof or else ont say it s a fact fokkof yall have been instructed to tell us that lol did people belief the lie that they are linked if it did in some countries why here in south africa won t don t tell us but show us the research evidence report evidence has shown this will need massive job to some disciples to this otherwise it s also a disaster in the shelves please watch this link this ad by microsoft was since removed and replaced with a different version after huge negative backlash which fool can believe such bull 5g is technology and covid19 is a virus wow do u know come see this tell us wat it does then we need to knw its disadvantages too u are a public broadcaster sont just make a statement without explaining now that you ve said it i have more reasons to believe it does it does kill bees though just saying there is no conclusive evidence why should we donate for covid 19 with our airtime to telkom when telkom is the only big telecommunications and network installer in the country are we finding the 5g installation with our airtime in the name of covid19 then why are birds dying when they stand on the towers of 5g u who said it does or you guys know something we don t leave us alone we have more to worry about than 5g tsek sa express staff still waking up to this harsh reality of not being paid during covid 19 no food no essentials some facing eviction please sa retweet to make gov pay sax salaries y nd what exactly is a 5g nd y their busy wit it in this difficulties course we only want the vaccine that wil help our people only even if 5g is the problem they won t tell us because there s big money to be made out of it why haven t anyone talked about it just posting a poster about 5g won t convince the people that 5g is save please get experts on board like 1 5g expert 2 health expert 3 law expert on technologies that causes health risks just poor journalism only people spread the virus flu like symptoms from 5g the issues no one knows dont make conclusions here is what science not the china says anyway is true it doesn t spread it but it cause it yeah but they destroy human health hey wen admin how do you know then explain this in china it s true 5g do not spread covad 19 but it s a source behind man suffering today for the world s growth and radical change there is always sacrifices so please tell on how are we going to use now africa resources to develop our land and our people amp industrialize africa this has been a topic from 2019 and you you are only paying interest now hoekom nou ie⁴ so 5g networks neither transmit any radiation as well this sounds like the quality of lessons we have been receiving through sabc platforms we know you are paid to say that but guess what where there s a smoke there s fire all governments throughout the world don t know the cause of this covid 19 then why are they quick to criticize those who says 5g is the cause how can you find a cure not knowing the cause the most dangerous thing to the world is capitalism because capitalism doesn t care about life only money what pressurized sabc to focus on conspiracy you guys need to stick to your lane and leave conspiracy alone the virus is created to depopulate the human race as people are saying this is part of the population control plan are you willing to comment on that to proof please i will be watching on 404 reading the comments with dismay people actually believe that 5g spread cause covid19 ignorance amp stupidity should be classified as a disease if 5g is not a

so for those who are buying face masks can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air so imma do a quick coronavirus thread with facts and information since people seem like google ain t free and because should i wear a mask people with no respiratory symptoms such as cough do not need to wear a medical mask who world health organization advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis use of masks can i catch covid 19 from my pets is it safe to recieve a package from where the virus has been reported yes the chance of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching it from a package that travelled and exposed to diff conditions and temps is also low is there anything i shouldnt do the following measures are not effective against covid 2019 and can be harmful smoking taking traditional herbal remedies wearing multiple masks taking self medication such as antibiotics well that concludes my information session please use it and take care of yourself and wash your hands and behind ,0
what do you mean by brought these issues to light are you talking about press leaks sticking it on a forum a tweet rangers went through the complaints system to the letter are you really suggesting rangers should ve breached confidentiality like giving vote results early he did he was fobbed off time amp again rangers complained about mclennan even being appointed they also complained about doncaster when he was previously made the subject of an enquiry in youth football where he was accused of lying this hasn t popped up out of the blue he did he was fobbed off time amp again is there any actual proof to back up your claim here there may be in the minutes you ll have to ask the spfl specifically nd amp rm why the minutes weren t signed off for months as it is the reaction of rangers satisfies me that they were getting fobbed off that s why we are where we are now the minutes should have been signed off and any other concerns dealt with but it s absolutely bizarre that no one not one single person brought these issues to light until dundee s vote got lost in the spfl computer system no i m saying he should have brought the issues up at the time i think rangers thought something dodgy went down when dundee s vote was lost came out shouting and when it was shown to be a glitch in the system rangers have tried to justify their initial claim of corruption show me where rangers claimed corruption point it out in a statement in the dossier or in an interview or on the website you said it back it up ,0
my source the who says what most public health experts say can the virus that causes covid 19 be transmitted through the air studies to date suggest that the virus that causes covid 19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air are the experts telling us it s going to be worse so when it s not as bad we are pleasantly surprised watch risk psychology expert join on last night s sadly this guy was supposed to be an expert on risk and he was saying rather ignorantly that folks on planes and airplanes could be safe if they didn t touch things but the virus is mostly airborne that s dangerously misleading at the most important time stay say out there yes this is true but how are respiratory droplets spread people cough them into the air and then they move through the air they literally spread in the air you guys are right that i was too unequivocal and imprecise particles do travel in the air about 5 6 feet then they drop which is why all pub health officials say the main way the virus spreads is contact unless we re close together ,0

6 so what is the logic behind easing lockdown early could it be the same logic that was behind the decisions not to screen at airports not to ban public events in march to delay lockdown etc the logic of of taking it on the chin 3 i think it s extraordinarily risky i don t think anyone could believe from the scientific point of view that this is a wise move former csa sir david king thinks easing lockdown too quickly makes the risk of a second wave very significant 4 do you think the pm went against the will of his scientists this is definitely a political decision he points out that lifting lockdown too early doesn t make sense from a scientific or an economic perspective 5 alok sharma just told bbc that the govt has met it s 5 tests amp that we had almost 240 000 people tested on monday yesterday said he didn t have the data on how many people had been tested the uk doesn t have a digital test trace isolate system in place 7 makes sense as an outcome not as a strategy but on 12 3 briefed by no 10 wrote the strategy of the govt is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so we acquire herd immunity has this goal really changed 8 as well as costing hundreds of thousands of lives would depend on people developing immunity to which is not certain antibodies don t equal immunity amp immunity to other human coronaviruses e g sars amp mers is only temporary 9 the govt deny was ever their strategy many think it was until the 16 march when new data emerged but uk lockdown was intended to prevent the nhs being overwhelmed rather than being part of a full suppression elimination strategy 10 the uk govt isn t all alone last month was asked if the us just have to accept the idea that by reopening there will be more death we have to be warriors we can t keep our country closed down for years he replied 11 but the pm doesn t talk of death instead he tells us cautious optimism is palpable on 3 feb he was optimistic too warning against medically irrational reactions to that could damage the economy was this strategy 12 now is not the time for blame it s a time for honesty for transparency and for unity there are massive decisions facing our country in the coming months we need sober leadship responsible journalism amp for govt to listen to all our top scientists 13 lack of transparency means little hard proof of plans but a leaked document shows on 23 3 faculty contracted with palantir to build nhsx platform proposed a simulation to assess the impact of targeted herd immunity an oxymoron 14 if you d like to find out more about the check out my long amp intersecting threads or visit a new investigative amp campaigning platform related scandals include 15 govt suspects uk is experiencing 7 000 daily infections amp that r rate might be higher than 1 leaked 18 6 covid situation report says we cannot preclude r being above 1 in england it also estimates the daily infections at 7 000 not 1 346 16 this document should be in the public domain there s nothing in it that justifies secrecy the fact we have to ask if we can share these things is crazy it s even crazier we might be told no phe are unable to publish anything without govt say so source 17 obtaining information from the govt is hard ministers fail to answer straightforward questions sage minutes are withheld redacted amp posted late on weekends bodies like nhs amp phe don t provide facts to parliamentary committees let alone to media 18 today there were another 154 reported deaths from on the day that the uk finally locked down on 23 march there were 102 uk covid deaths re tweet 17 could you tell us whether phe have submitted the document they said they would 3 months ago 19 four months in amp we still don t know the govt s objective is the objective still to let flow through the population amp just to stay within nhs capacity asks if so that would explain the deadly strategy 20 in april the govt changed the 5th test for easing lockdown from ensuring any adjustments will not risk a second peak to adjustments will not overwhelm the nhs when asked why he said i m not sure i can tell you 21 that patrick vallance amp no minister has been able to tell us why this significant change was made is extraordinary but unsurprising but we don t actually need them to explain the answer is v clear the govt is pursuing a strategy 22 the fact the govt never diverted from the strategy makes the thinking behind their often inexplicable in actions fall into place the bewildering multiplicity of scandals are all part of one single scandal the 23 uk isn t alone in attempting a strategy sweden was open about it amp has a mortality rate 7x higher than rest of eu with cases rising 16x faster us amp brazil have a policy of opening the economy dutch situation echoes uk 24 ons figures released today show a slight increase in community transmission amp that the downward trend has levelled off it shows only 1 in 1100 are estimated to be infected ystdy us had the highest single day total of new infections we shouldn t read too much into these figures the study found only 14 positive cases in 25 000 tests amp ons says we don t have evidence that the current trend is anything other than flat i fear we are not in the dance phase but rather back on the mitigation trajectory 26 asked by why uk has the highest death rate in the world suggests it could be to with the weather even things as simple as the weather may have influenced has spread amp so may the practices of individual cultures amp societies 27 asked how many people are be being tested per day said ystdy we don t have those data the govt haven t released the figures for more than a month yet ministers seem happy to blurt out big numbers amp tell us how well the uk is doing 28 italy s health minister says told italy s pm on 13 3 that he wants on 12 3 wrote the strategy of the govt is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity the govt didn t correct him 29 the number of suspected coronavirus outbreaks in schools almost doubled last week new public health england figures show there number of acute respiratory outbreaks in schools rose from 24 to 44 16 more outbreaks than were recorded at hospitals 30 the uk has moved from 4th from bottom to 24th from bottom of a global league in tackling coronavirus the uk is now 155th out of 179 nations in the 2nd study by oxford university s blavatnik school of govt the study looks at the who s six tests 31 this visual shows how over 5 months from 1 jan became more deadly than malaria bigger killers eg heart disease stroke etc aren t included covid cases are rising today s figures 9 8m cases 480k deaths by tony nickonchur amp gavin wood uk hardest hit of all g7 nations in the weeks leading up to early june according to bbc england fared the worst in europe just above spain the research compared 11 week periods for each nation as the virus hit its peak in each country 33 up to 90 of new cases at local level are missing from the govt data this means that the public school governors local businesses journalists writing about the presence or absence of new outbreaks etc are being deliberately fed misleading data 34 it wasn t data protection stopping testing info going to councils the requirement wasn t in the contract the contract with deloitte doesn t require the company to report positive cases to phe amp local authorities email to via he covers up crime with scandal amp covers up malice with incompetence they want to project an image of being inept instead of as having a cruel amp well defined plan on trump s admin sound familiar all part of 36 failure to publish pillar 2 data public test results amp then covering it up is a scandal starmer says a week was lost b c the local authority didn t have the right data claims pillar 1 amp 2 data was shared the mayor of leicester only got it on thursday yes not enough have died and yet there is still no proof as far as i m aware that having the virus gives you immunity for anything more than a few months within this context any herd immunity policy is more like state sanctioned murder no no it s the simple logic that there would be catastrophic economic damage if it continued for much longer easing it early are you actually being serious people have been locked away for three months for gods sake why not have a discussion about the growing mental health issue in this country because of it or is it ok for teenagers to kill themselves you won t reply obviously ,0
